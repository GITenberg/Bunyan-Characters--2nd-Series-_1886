<h1>BUNYAN CHARACTERS&mdash;SECOND SERIES<br />
Lectures delivered in St. George&rsquo;s Free Church Edinburgh<br />
By Alexander Whyte, D.D.</h1>
<h2>IGNORANCE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was alive without the law once.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was now a brisk talker also myself in the matter of religion.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bunyan</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a new kind of pilgrim.&nbsp; There are not many pilgrims
like this bright brisk youth.&nbsp; A few more young gentlemen like
this, and the pilgrimage way would positively soon become fashionable
and popular, and be the thing to do.&nbsp; Had you met with this young
gentleman in society, had you noticed him beginning to come about your
church, you would have lost no time in finding out who he was.&nbsp;
I can well believe it, you would have replied.&nbsp; Indeed, I felt
sure of it.&nbsp; I must ask him to the house.&nbsp; I was quite struck
with his appearance and his manners.&nbsp; Yes; ask him at once to your
house; show him some pointed attentions and you will never regret it.&nbsp;
For if he goes to the bar and works even decently at his cases, he will
be first a sheriff and then a judge in no time.&nbsp; If he should take
to politics, he will be an under-secretary before his first parliament
is out.&nbsp; And if he takes to the church, which is not at all unlikely,
our West-end congregations will all be competing for him as their junior
colleague; and, if he elects either of our Established churches to exercise
his profession in it, he will have dined with Her Majesty while half
of his class-fellows are still half-starved probationers.&nbsp; Society
fathers will point him out with anger to their unsuccessful sons, and
society mothers will smile under their eyelids as they see him hanging
over their daughters.</p>
<p>Well, as this handsome and well-appointed youth stepped out of his
own neat little lane into the rough road on which our two pilgrims were
staggering upward, he felt somewhat ashamed to be seen in their company.&nbsp;
And I do not wonder.&nbsp; For a greater contrast you would not have
seen on any road in all that country that day.&nbsp; He was at your
very first sight of him a gentleman and the son of a gentleman.&nbsp;
A little over-dressed perhaps; as, also, a little lofty to the two rather
battered but otherwise decent enough men who, being so much older than
he, took the liberty of first accosting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brisk&rdquo;
is his biographer&rsquo;s description of him.&nbsp; Feather-headed,
flippant, and almost impudent, you might have been tempted to say of
him had you joined the little party at that moment.&nbsp; But those
two tumbled, broken-winded, and, indeed, broken-hearted old men had
been, as an old author says, so emptied from vessel to vessel&mdash;they
had had a life of such sloughs and stiff climbs&mdash;they had been
in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness so often&mdash;that it was
no wonder that their dandiacal companion walked on a little ahead of
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; his fine clothes and his cane and
his head in the air all said to his two somewhat disreputable-looking
fellow-travellers,&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, you be utter strangers to
me: I know you not.&nbsp; And, besides, I take my pleasure in walking
alone, even more a great deal than in company, unless I like it better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But all his society manners, and all his costly and well-kept clothes,
and all his easy and self-confident airs did not impose upon the two
wary old pilgrims.&nbsp; They had seen too much of the world, and had
been too long mixing among all kinds of pilgrims, young and old, true
and false, to be easily imposed upon.&nbsp; Besides, as one could see
from their weather-beaten faces, and their threadbare garments, they
had found the upward way so dreadfully difficult that they both felt
a real apprehension as to the future of this light-hearted and light-headed
youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may find some difficulty at the gate,&rdquo;
somewhat bluntly broke in the oldest of the two pilgrims on their young
comrade.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall, no doubt, do at the gate as other good
people do,&rdquo; replied the young gentleman briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what have you to show at the gate that may cause that the gate be opened
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I know my Lord&rsquo;s will, and I
have been a good liver all my days, and I pay every man his own.&nbsp;
I pray, moreover, and I fast.&nbsp; I pay tithes, and give alms, and
have left my country for whither I am going.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, before
we go further: Do all you young gentlemen do as much as that?&nbsp;
Have you always been good livers?&nbsp; Have you paid every man and
woman their due?&nbsp; Do you pray to be called prayer?&nbsp; And, if
so, when, and where, and what for, and how long at a time?&nbsp; I do
not ask if your private prayer-book is like Bishop Andrewes&rsquo; <i>Devotions</i>,
which was so reduced to pulp with tears and sweat and the clenching
of his agonising hands that his literary executors were with difficulty
able to decipher it.&nbsp; Clito in the <i>Christian Perfection</i>
was so expeditious with his prayers that he used to boast that he could
both dress and do his devotions in a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; What
was the longest time you ever took to dress or undress and say your
prayers?&nbsp; Then, again, there is another Anglican young gentleman
in the same High Church book who always fasts on Good Friday and the
Thirtieth of January.&nbsp; Did you ever deny yourself a glass of wine
or a cigar or an opera ticket for the church or the poor?&nbsp; Could
you honestly say that you know what tithes are?&nbsp; And is there a
poor man or woman or child in this whole city who will by any chance
put your name into their prayers and praises at bedtime to-night?&nbsp;
I am afraid there are not many young gentlemen in this house to-night
who could cast a stone at that brisk lad Ignorance, Vain-Hope, door
in the side of the hill, and all.&nbsp; He was not far from the kingdom
of heaven; indeed, he got up to the very gate of it.&nbsp; How many
of you will get half as far?</p>
<p>Now (what think you?), was it not a very bold thing in John Bunyan,
whose own descent was of such a low and inconsiderable generation, his
father&rsquo;s house being of that rank that is meanest and most despised
of all the families in the land&mdash;was it not almost too bold in
such a clown to take such a gentleman-scholar as Saul of Tarsus, the
future Apostle of the Lord, and put him into the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>, and there go on to describe him as a very brisk lad and
nickname him with the nickname of Ignorance?&nbsp; For, in knowledge
of all kinds to be called knowledge, Gamaliel&rsquo;s gold medallist
could have bought the unlettered tinker of Elstow in one end of the
market and sold him in the other.&nbsp; And nobody knew that better
than Bunyan did.&nbsp; And yet such a lion was he for the truth, such
a disciple of Luther was he, and such a defender and preacher of the
one doctrine of a standing or falling church, that he fills page after
page with the crass ignorance of the otherwise most learned of all the
New Testament men.&nbsp; Bunyan does not accuse the rising hope of the
Pharisees of school or of synagogue ignorance.&nbsp; That young Hebrew
Rabbi knew every jot and tittle of the law of Moses, and all the accumulated
traditions of the fathers to boot.&nbsp; But Bunyan has Paul himself
with him when he accuses and convicts Saul of an absolutely brutish
ignorance of his own heart and hidden nature.&nbsp; That so very brisk
lad was always boasting in himself of the day on which he was circumcised,
and of the old stock of which he had come; of his tribe, of his zeal,
of his blamelessness, and of the profit he had made of his educational
and ecclesiastical opportunities.&nbsp; Whereas Bunyan is fain to say
of himself in his <i>Grace Abounding</i> that he is &ldquo;not able
to boast of noble blood or of a high-born state according to the flesh.&nbsp;
Though, all things considered, I magnify the Heavenly Majesty for that
by this door He brought me into this world to partake of the grace and
life that is in Christ by the Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we listen to the conversation that goes on between the two old
pilgrims and this smartly appointed youth, we find them striving hard,
but without any sign of success, to convince him of some of the things
from which he gets his somewhat severe name.&nbsp; For one thing, they
at last bluntly told him that he evidently did not know the very A B
C about himself.&nbsp; Till, when too hard pressed by the more ruthless
of the two old men, the exasperated youth at last frankly burst out:
&ldquo;I will never believe that my heart is thus bad!&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is a warm touch of Bunyan&rsquo;s own experience here, mixed up
with his so dramatic development of Paul&rsquo;s morsels of autobiography
that he lets drop in his Epistles to the Philippians and to the Galatians.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now was I become godly; now I was become a right honest man.&nbsp;
Though as yet I was nothing but a poor painted hypocrite, yet I was
proud of my godliness.&nbsp; I read my Bible, but as for Paul&rsquo;s
Epistles, and such like Scriptures, I could not away with them; being,
as yet, but ignorant both of the corruptions of my nature and of the
want and worth of Jesus Christ to save me.&nbsp; The new birth did never
enter my mind, neither knew I the deceitfulness and treachery of my
own wicked heart.&nbsp; And as for secret thoughts, I took no notice
of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; My brethren, old and young, what do you think
of all that?&nbsp; What have you to say to all that?&nbsp; Does all
that not open a window and let a flood of daylight into your own breast?&nbsp;
I am sure it does.&nbsp; That is the best portrait of you that ever
was painted.&nbsp; Do you not see yourself there as in a glass?&nbsp;
And do you not turn with disgust and loathing from the stupid and foolish
face?&nbsp; You complain and tell stories about how impostors and cheats
and liars have come to your door and have impudently thrust themselves
into your innermost rooms; but your own heart, if you only knew it,
is deceitful far above them all.&nbsp; Not the human heart as it stands
in confessions, and in catechisms, and in deep religious books, but
your own heart that beats out its blood-poison of self-deceit, and darkness,
and death day and night continually.&nbsp; &ldquo;My heart is a good
heart,&rdquo; said that poor ill-brought-up boy, who was already destroyed
by his father and his mother for lack of self-knowledge.&nbsp; I entirely
grant you that those two old sinners by this time were taking very pessimistic
and very melancholy views of human nature, and, therefore, of every
human being, young and old.&nbsp; They knew that no language had ever
been coined in any scripture, or creed, or catechism, or secret diary
of the deepest penitent, that even half uttered their own evil hearts;
and they had lived long enough to see that we are all cut out of one
web, are all dyed in one vat, and are all corrupted beyond all accusation
or confession in Adam&rsquo;s corruption.&nbsp; But how was that poor,
mishandled lad to know or believe all that?&nbsp; He could not.&nbsp;
It was impossible.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go so fast, gentlemen, that I cannot
keep pace with you.&nbsp; Go you on before and I will stay a while behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then said Christian to his companion: &ldquo;It pities me much for this
poor lad, for it will certainly go ill with him at last.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Hopeful, &ldquo;there are abundance in our
town in his condition: whole families, yea, whole streets, and that
of pilgrims too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is your family such a family as this?&nbsp;
And are you yourself just such a pilgrim as Ignorance was, and are you
hastening on to just such an end?</p>
<p>And then, as a consequence, being wholly ignorant of his own corruption
and condemnation in the sight of God, this miserable man must remain
ignorant and outside of all that God has done in Christ for corrupt
and condemned men.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe that Christ died for sinners
and that I shall be justified before God from the curse through His
gracious acceptance of my obedience to His law.&nbsp; Or, then, to take
it this way, Christ makes my duties that are religious acceptable to
His Father by virtue of His merits, and so shall I be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, I verify believe that nine out of ten of the young men who are
here to-night would subscribe that statement and never suspect there
was anything wrong with it or with themselves.&nbsp; And yet, what does
Christian, who, in this matter, is just John Bunyan, who again is just
the word of God&mdash;what does the old pilgrim say to this confession
of this young pilgrim&rsquo;s faith?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ignorance is thy name,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;and as thy name is, so art thou: even this thy answer
demonstrateth what I say.&nbsp; Ignorant thou art of what justifying
righteousness is, and as ignorant how to secure thy soul through the
faith of it from the heavy wrath of God.&nbsp; Yea, thou also art ignorant
of the true effect of saving faith in this righteousness of Christ&rsquo;s,
which is to bow and win over the heart to God in Christ, to love His
name, His word, His ways, and His people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul sums up
all his own early life in this one word, &ldquo;ignorant of God&rsquo;s
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Going about,&rdquo; he says also,
&ldquo;to establish our own righteousness, not submitting ourselves
to be justified by the righteousness that God has provided with such
wisdom and grace, and at such a cost in His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, young men, I defy you to be better born, better brought up, or
to have better prospects than Saul of Tarsus had.&nbsp; I defy you to
have profited more by all your opportunities and advantages than he
had done.&nbsp; I defy you to be more blameless in your opening manhood
than he was.&nbsp; And yet it all went like smoke when he got a true
sight of himself, and, with that, a true sight of Christ and His justifying
righteousness.&nbsp; Read at home to-night, and read when alone, what
that great man of God says about all that in his classical epistle to
the Philippians, and refuse to sleep till you have made the same submission.&nbsp;
And, to-night, and all your days, let <i>submission</i>, Paul&rsquo;s
splendid submission, be the soul and spirit of all your religious life.&nbsp;
Submission to be searched by God&rsquo;s holy law as by a lighted candle:
submission to be justified from all that that candle discovers: submission
to take Christ as your life and righteousness, sanctification and redemption:
and submission of your mind and your will and your heart to Him at all
times and in all things.&nbsp; Nay, stay still, and say where you sit,
Lord, I submit.&nbsp; I submit on the spot to be pardoned.&nbsp; I submit
now to be saved.&nbsp; I submit in all things from this very hour and
house of God not any longer to be mine own, but to be Thine, O God,
Thine, Thine, for ever, in Jesus Christ Thy Son and my Saviour!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, one day, as I was passing in the field, and that, too,
with some dashes in my conscience, fearing lest all was not right, suddenly
this sentence fell upon my soul, Thy Righteousness is in heaven!&nbsp;
And, methought, I saw with the eyes of my soul Jesus Christ at God&rsquo;s
right hand.&nbsp; There, I saw, was my Righteousness.&nbsp; I also saw,
moreover, that it was not my good frame of heart that made my Righteousness
better, nor my bad frame of heart that made my Righteousness worse:
for my Righteousness was Jesus Christ Himself, the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas glorious to me to see His exaltation,
and the worth and prevalency of His benefits.&nbsp; And that because
I could now look from myself to Him and should reckon that all those
graces of God that were now green in me were yet but like those crack-groats
and four-pence halfpennies that rich men carry in their purses when
their gold is in their trunks at home!&nbsp; Oh, I saw that day that
my gold was all in my trunk at home!&nbsp; Even in Christ, my Lord and
Saviour!&nbsp; Now, Christ was all to me: all my wisdom, all my righteousness,
all my sanctification and all my redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Methinks in this God speaks,<br />
No tinker hath such power.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>LITTLE-FAITH</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O thou of little faith.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little-Faith, let it never be forgotten, was, all the time, a good
man.&nbsp; With all his mistakes about himself, with his sad misadventure,
with all his loss of blood and of money, and with his whole after-lifetime
of doleful and bitter complaints,&mdash;all the time, Little-Faith was
all through, in a way, a good man.&nbsp; To keep us right on this all-important
point, and to prevent our being prematurely prejudiced against this
pilgrim because of his somewhat prejudicial name&mdash;because give
a dog a bad name, you know, and you had better hang him out of hand
at once&mdash;because, I say, of this pilgrim&rsquo;s somewhat suspicious
name, his scrupulously just, and, indeed, kindly affected biographer
says of him, and says it of him not once nor twice, but over and over
and over again, that this Little-Faith was really all the time a truly
good man.&nbsp; And, more than that, this good man&rsquo;s goodness
was not a new thing with him it was not a thing of yesterday.&nbsp;
This man had, happily to begin with, a good father and a good mother.&nbsp;
And if there was a good town in all those parts for a boy to be born
and brought up in it was surely the town of Sincere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Train
up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart
from it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, Little-Faith had been so trained up both
by his father and his mother and his schoolmaster and his minister,
and he never cost either of them a sore heart or even an hour&rsquo;s
sleep.&nbsp; One who knew him well, as well, indeed, as only one young
man knows another, has been fain to testify, when suspicions have been
cast on the purity and integrity of his youth, that nothing will describe
this pilgrim so well in the days of his youth as just those beautiful
words out of the New Testament&mdash;&ldquo;an example to all young
men in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith even,
and in purity&rdquo;&mdash;and that, if there was one young man in all
that town of Sincere who kept his garments unspotted it was just our
pilgrim of to-night.&nbsp; Yes, said one who had known him all his days,
if the child is the father of the man, then Little-Faith, as you so
unaccountably to me call him, must have been all along a good man.</p>
<p>It was said long ago in <i>Vanity Fair</i> about our present Premier
that if he were a worse man he would be a better statesman.&nbsp; Now,
I do not repeat that in this place because I agree with it, but because
it helps to illustrate, as sometimes a violent paradox will help to
illustrate, a truth that does not lie all at once on the surface.&nbsp;
But it is no paradox or extravagance or anything but the simple truth
to say that if Little-Faith had had more and earlier discoveries made
to him of the innate evil of his own heart, even if it had been by that
innate evil bursting out of his heart and laying waste his good life,
he would either have been driven out of his little faith altogether
or driven into a far deeper faith.&nbsp; Had the commandment come to
him in the manner it came to Paul; had it come so as that the sinfulness
of his inward nature had revived, as Paul says, under its entrance;
then, either his great goodness or his little faith must have there
and then died.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s truth and man&rsquo;s goodness cannot
dwell together in the same heart.&nbsp; Either the truth will kill the
goodness, or the goodness will kill the truth.&nbsp; Little-Faith, in
short, was such a good man, and had always been such a good man, and
had led such an easy life in consequence, that his faith had not been
much exercised, and therefore had not grown, as it must have been exercised
and must have grown, had he not been such a good man.&nbsp; In short,
and to put it bluntly, had Little-Faith been a worse sinner, he would
have been a better saint.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>O felix culpa</i>!&rdquo;
exclaimed a church father; &ldquo;O happy fault, which found for us
sinners such a Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; An apostrophe which Bishop Ken
has put into these four bold lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What Adam did amiss,<br />
Turned to our endless bliss;<br />
O happy sin, which to atone,<br />
Drew Filial God to leave His throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And John Calvin, the soberest of men, supports Augustine, the most
impulsive of men, in saying the same thing.&nbsp; All things which happen
to the saints are so overruled by God that what the world regards as
evil the issue shows to be good.&nbsp; For what Augustine says is true,
that even the sins of saints are, through the guiding providence of
God, so far from doing harm to them, that, on the contrary, they serve
to advance their salvation.&nbsp; And Richard Hooker, a theologian,
if possible, still more judicious than even John Calvin, says on this
same subject and in support of the same great father, &ldquo;I am not
afraid to affirm it boldly with St. Augustine that men puffed up through
a proud opinion of their own sanctity and holiness receive a benefit
at the hands of God, and are assisted with His grace, when with His
grace they are not assisted, but permitted, and that grievously, to
transgress.&nbsp; Ask the very soul of Peter, and it shall undoubtedly
make you itself this answer: My eager protestations, made in the glory
of my ghostly strength, I am ashamed of; but those crystal tears, wherewith
my sin and weakness were bewailed, have procured my endless joy: my
strength hath been my ruin, and my fall my stay.&rdquo;&nbsp; And our
own Samuel Rutherford is not likely to be left far behind by the best
of them when the grace of God is to be magnified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had sin
never been we should have wanted the mysterious Emmanuel, the Beloved,
the Chief among ten thousand, Christ, God-man, the Saviour of sinners.&nbsp;
For, no sick sinners, no soul-physician of sinners; no captive, no Redeemer;
no slave of hell, no lovely ransom-payer of heaven.&nbsp; Mary Magdalene
with her seven devils, Paul with his hands smoking with the blood of
the saints, and with his heart sick with malice and blasphemy against
Christ and His Church, and all the rest of the washen ones whose robes
are made fair in the blood of the Lamb, and all the multitude that no
man can number in that best of lands, are all but bits of free grace.&nbsp;
O what a depth of unsearchable wisdom to contrive that lovely plot of
free grace.&nbsp; Come, all intellectual capacities, and warm your hearts
at this fire.&nbsp; Come, all ye created faculties, and smell the precious
ointment of Christ.&nbsp; Oh come, sit down under His shadow and eat
the apples of life.&nbsp; Oh that angels would come, and generations
of men, and wonder, and admire, and fall down before the unsearchable
wisdom of this gospel-art of the unsearchable riches of Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And always pungent Thomas Shepard of New England: &ldquo;You shall find
this, that there is not any carriage or passage of the Lord&rsquo;s
providence toward thee but He will get a name to Himself, first and
last, by it.&nbsp; Hence you shall find that those very sins that dishonour
His name He will even by them get Himself a better name; for so far
will they be from casting you out of His love that He will actually
do thee good by them.&nbsp; Look and see if it is not so with thee?&nbsp;
Doth not thy weakness strengthen thee like Paul?&nbsp; Doth not thy
blindness make thee cry for light?&nbsp; And hath not God out of darkness
oftentimes brought light?&nbsp; Thou hast felt venom against Christ
and thy brother, and thou hast on that account loathed thyself the more.&nbsp;
Thy falls into sin make thee weary of it, watchful against it, long
to be rid of it.&nbsp; And thus He makes thy poison thy food, thy death
thy life, thy damnation thy salvation, and thy very greatest enemies
thy very best friends.&nbsp; And hence Mr. Fox said that he thanked
God more for his sins than for his good works.&nbsp; And the reason
is, God will have His name.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, last, but not least, listen
to our old acquaintance, James Fraser of Brea: &ldquo;I find advantages
by my sins: &lsquo;<i>Peccare nocet, peccavisse vero juvat</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I may say, as Mr. Fox said, my sins have, in a manner, done me more
good than my graces.&nbsp; Grace and mercy have more abounded where
sin had much abounded.&nbsp; I am by my sins made much more humble,
watchful, revengeful against myself.&nbsp; I am made to see a greater
need to depend more upon Him and to love Him the more.&nbsp; I find
that true which Shepard says, &lsquo;sin loses strength by every new
fall.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you followed all that, my brethren?&nbsp;
Or have you stumbled at it?&nbsp; Do you not understand it?&nbsp; Does
your superficial gin-horse mind incline to shake its empty head over
all this?&nbsp; I know that great names, and especially the great names
of your own party, go much farther with you than the truth goes, and
therefore I have sheltered this deep truth under a shield of great names.&nbsp;
For their sakes let this sure truth of God&rsquo;s best saints lie in
peace and undisputed beside you till you arrive to understand it.</p>
<p>But, to proceed,&mdash;the thing was this.&nbsp; At this passage
there comes down from Broadway-gate a lane called Dead-Man&rsquo;s-lane,
so called because of the murders that are commonly done there.&nbsp;
And this Little-Faith going on pilgrimage, as we now do, chanced to
sit down there and fell fast asleep.&nbsp; Yes; the thing was this:
This good man had never been what one would call really awake.&nbsp;
He was not a bad man, as men went in the town of Sincere, but he always
had a half-slept half-awakened look about his eyes, till now, at this
most unfortunate spot, he fell stone-dead asleep.&nbsp; You all know,
I shall suppose, what the apostle Paul and John Bunyan mean by sleep,
do you not?&nbsp; You all know, at any rate, to begin with, what sleep
means in the accident column of the morning papers.&nbsp; You all know
what sleep meant and what it involved and cost in the Thirsk signal-box
the other night. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&nbsp;
When a man is asleep, he is as good as dead, and other people are as
good as dead to him.&nbsp; He is dead to duty, to danger, to other people&rsquo;s
lives, as well as to his own.&nbsp; He may be having pleasant dreams,
and may even be laughing aloud in his sleep, but that may only make
his awaking all the more hideous.&nbsp; He may awake just in time, or
he may awake just too late.&nbsp; Only, he is asleep and he neither
knows nor cares.&nbsp; Now, there is a sleep of the soul as well as
of the body.&nbsp; And as the soul is in worth, as the soul is in its
life and in its death to the body, so is its sleep.&nbsp; Many of you
sitting there are quite as dead to heaven and hell, to death and judgment,
and to what a stake other people as well as yourselves have in your
sleep as that poor sleeper in the signal-box was dead to what was coming
rushing on him through the black night.&nbsp; And as all his gnashing
of teeth at himself, and all his sobs before his judge and before the
laid-out dead, and before distracted widows and half-mad husbands did
not bring back that fatal moment when he fell asleep so sweetly, so
will it be with you.&nbsp; Lazarus! come forth!&nbsp; Wise and foolish
virgins both: Behold the Bridegroom cometh!&nbsp; Awake, thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light!</p>
<p>And, with that, Guilt with a great club that was in his hand struck
Little-Faith on the head, and with that blow felled him to the earth,
where he lay bleeding as one that would soon bleed to death.&nbsp; Yes,
yes, all true to the very life.&nbsp; A man may be the boast and the
example of all the town, and yet, unknown to them all, and all but unknown
to himself till he is struck down, he may have had guilt enough on his
track all the time to lay him half dead at the mouth of Dead-Man&rsquo;s-lane.&nbsp;
Good as was the certificate that all men in their honesty gave to Little-Faith,
yet even he had some bad enough memories behind him and within him had
he only kept them ever present with him.&nbsp; But, then, it was just
this that all along was the matter with Little-Faith.&nbsp; Till, somehow,
after that sad and yet not wholly evil sleep, all his past sins leapt
out into the light and suddenly became and remained all the rest of
his life like scarlet.&nbsp; So loaded, indeed, was the club of Guilt
with the nails and studs and clamps of secret aggravation, that every
nail and stud left its own bleeding bruise in the prostrate man&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; I have myself, says the narrator of Little-Faith&rsquo;s
story, I have myself been engaged as he was, and I found it to be a
terrible thing.&nbsp; I would, as the saying is, have sold my life at
that moment for a penny; but that, as God would have it, I was clothed
with armour of proof: ay, and yet though I was thus harnessed, I found
it hard work to quit myself like a man.&nbsp; No man can tell what in
that combat attends us but he that hath been in the battle himself.&nbsp;
Great-Grace himself,&mdash;whoso looks well upon his face shall see
those cuts and scars that shall easily give demonstration of what I
say.</p>
<p>Most unfortunately there was no good Samaritan with his beast on
the road that day to take the half-dead man to an inn.&nbsp; And thus
it was that Little-Faith was left to lie in his blood till there was
almost no more blood left in him.&nbsp; Till at last, coming a little
to himself, he made a shift to scrabble on his way.&nbsp; When he was
able to look a little to himself, besides all his wounds and loss of
blood, he found that all his spending money was gone, and what was he
to do, a stranger in such a plight on a strange road?&nbsp; There was
nothing for it but he must just beg his way with many a hungry belly
for the remainder of his way.&nbsp; You all understand the parable at
this point?&nbsp; Our knowledge of gospel truth; our personal experience
of the life of God in our own soul; our sensible attainments in this
grace of the Spirit and in that; in secret prayer, in love to God, in
forgiveness of injuries, in goodwill to all men, and in self-denial
that no one knows of,&mdash;in things like these we possess what may
be called the pocket-money of the spiritual life.&nbsp; All these things,
at their best, are not the true jewel that no thief can break through
nor steal; but though they are not our best and truest riches, yet they
have their place and play their part in sending us up the pilgrim way.&nbsp;
By our long and close study of the word of God, if that is indeed our
case; by divine truth dwelling richly and experimentally in our hearts;
and by a hidden life that is its own witness, and which always has the
Holy Spirit&rsquo;s seal set upon it that we are the children of God,&mdash;all
that keeps, and is designed by God to keep our hearts up amid the labours
and the faintings, the hopes and the fears of the spiritual life.&nbsp;
All that keeps us at the least and the worst above famine and beggary.&nbsp;
Now, the whole pity with Little-Faith was, that though he was not a
bad man, yet he never, even at his best days, had much of those things
that make a good and well-furnished pilgrim; and what little he had
he had now clean lost.&nbsp; He had never been much a reader of his
Bible; he had never sat over it as other men sat over their news-letters
and their romances.&nbsp; He had never had much taste or talent for
spiritual books of any kind.&nbsp; He was a good sort of man, but he
was not exactly the manner of man on whose broken heart the Holy Ghost
sets the broad seal of heaven.&nbsp; But for his dreadful misadventure,
he might have plodded on, a decent, humdrum, commonplace, everyday kind
of pilgrim; but when that catastrophe fell on him he had nothing to
fall back upon.&nbsp; The secret ways of faith and love and hope were
wholly unknown to him.&nbsp; He had no practice in importunate prayer.&nbsp;
He had never prayed a whole night all his life.&nbsp; He had never needed
to do so.&nbsp; For were we not told when we first met him what a blameless
and pure and true and good man he had always been?&nbsp; He did not
know how to find his way about in his Bible; and as for the maps and
guide-books that some pilgrims never let out of their hand, even when
he had some spending money about him, he never laid it out that way.&nbsp;
And a more helpless pilgrim than Little-Faith was all the rest of the
way you never saw.&nbsp; He was forced to beg as he went, says his historian.&nbsp;
That is to say, he had to lean upon and look to wiser and better-furnished
men than himself.&nbsp; He had to share their meals, look to them to
pay his bills, keep close to their company, walk in their foot-prints,
and at night borrow their oil, and it was only in this poor dependent
way that Little-Faith managed to struggle on to the end of his dim and
joyless journey.</p>
<p>It would have been far more becoming and far more profitable if Christian
and Hopeful, instead of falling out of temper and calling one another
bad names over the sad case of Little-Faith, had tried to tell one another
why that unhappy pilgrim&rsquo;s faith was so small, and how both their
own faith and his might from that day have been made more.&nbsp; Hopeful,
for some reason or other, was in a rude and boastful mood of mind that
day, and Christian was more tart and snappish than we have ever before
seen him; and, altogether, the opportunity of learning something useful
out of Little-Faith&rsquo;s story has been all but lost to us.&nbsp;
But, now, since there are so many of Little-Faith&rsquo;s kindred among
ourselves&mdash;so many good men who are either half asleep in their
religious life or are begging their way from door to door&mdash;let
them be told, in closing, one or two out of many other ways in which
their too little faith may possibly be made stronger and more fruitful.</p>
<p>Well, then, faith, like everything else, once we have it, grows greater
by our continual exercise of it.&nbsp; Exercise, then, intentionally
and seriously and on system your faith every day.&nbsp; And exercise
it habitually and increasingly on your Bible, on heaven, and on Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; And let your faith on all these things, and places, and
persons, work by love,&mdash;by love and by imagination.&nbsp; Our love
is cold and our faith is small and weak for lack of imagination.&nbsp;
Read your Psalm, your Gospel, your Epistle every morning and every night
with your eye upon the object.&nbsp; Think you see the Psalmist amid
all his deep and divine experiences.&nbsp; Think you see Jesus Christ
speaking His parables, saying His prayers, and doing His good works.&nbsp;
Walk up and down with Him, observing His manner, His look, His gait,
His divinity in your humanity, till Galilee and Jerusalem become Scotland
and Edinburgh; that is, till He is as much with you, and more, than
He was with Peter and James and John.&nbsp; Never close your eye a single
night till you have again laid your hand on the very head of the Lamb
of God, and till you feel that your sin and guilt have all passed off
your hand and on upon His head.&nbsp; And never rise without, like William
Law, saluting the rising sun in the name of God, as if he had just been
created and sent up into your sky to let you see to serve God and your
neighbour for another day.&nbsp; And be often out of this world and
up in heaven.&nbsp; Beat all about you at building castles in the air;
you have more material and more reason.&nbsp; For is not faith the substance
of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen?&nbsp; Walk
often in heaven&rsquo;s friendly streets.&nbsp; Pass often into heaven&rsquo;s
many mansions filled with happy families.&nbsp; Imagine this unhappy
life at an end, and imagine yourself sent back to this probationary
world to play the man for a few short years before heaven finally calls
you home.&nbsp; Little-Faith was a good man, but there was no speculation
in his eyes and no secrets of love in his heart.&nbsp; And if your faith
also is little, and your spending money also is run low, try this way
of love and imagination.&nbsp; If you have a better way, then go on
with it and be happy yourself and helpful to others; but if your faith
is at a standstill and is stricken with barrenness, try my counsel of
putting more heart and more inward eye, more holy love and more heavenly
joy, into your frigid and sterile religion.</p>
<h2>THE FLATTERER</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth
a net for his feet.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Wise Man</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Ignorance and Little-Faith would have had their revenge and
satisfaction upon Christian and Hopeful had they seen those two so Pharisaical
old men taken in the Flatterer&rsquo;s net.&nbsp; For it was nothing
else but the swaggering pride of Hopeful over the pitiful case of Little-Faith,
taken along with the hard and hasty ways of Christian with that unhappy
youth Ignorance, that so soon laid them both down under the small cords
of the Shining One.&nbsp; This word of the wise man, that pride goeth
before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall, was fulfilled
to the very letter in Christian and Hopeful that high-minded day.&nbsp;
At the same time, it must be admitted that Christian and Hopeful would
have been more than human if they had not both felt and let fall some
superiority, some scorn, and some impatience in the presence of such
a silly and upsetting stripling as Ignorance was; as, also, over the
story of such a poor-spirited and spunging creature as Little-Faith
was.&nbsp; Christian and Hopeful had just come down from their delightful
time among the Delectable Mountains, and they were as full as they could
hold of all kinds of knowledge, and faith, and hope, and assurance;
when, most unfortunately, as it turned out, they first came across Ignorance,
and then, after quarrelling with him, they fell out between themselves
over the case of Little-Faith.&nbsp; Their superior knowledge of the
truth, and their superior strength of faith, ought to have made them
more able to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and with the passing
moods, however provoking, of one another.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; And their
impatience and contempt and bad temper all came at this crisis to such
a head with them that they could only be cured by the small cords and
the stinging words of the Shining One.&nbsp; The true key to this so
painful part of the parable hangs at our own girdle.&nbsp; We who have
been born and brought up in an evangelical church are thrown from time
to time into the company of men&mdash;ministers and people&mdash;who
have not had our advantages and opportunities.&nbsp; They have been
born, baptized, and brought up in communities and churches the clean
opposite of ours; and they are as ignorant of all New Testament religion
as Ignorance himself was; or, on the other hand, they are as full of
superstition and terror and spiritual starvation as Little-Faith was.&nbsp;
And then, instead of recollecting and laying to heart Who made us to
differ from such ignorance and such unbelief, and thus putting on love
and humility and patience toward our neighbours, we speak scornfully
and roughly to them, and boast ourselves over them, and as good as say
to them, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am wiser, wider-minded,
stronger, and better every way than thou.&nbsp; And then, ere ever we
are aware of what we are doing, we have let the arch-flatterer of religious
superiority and of spiritual pride seduce us aside out of the lowly
and heavenly way of love and humility till we are again brought back
to it with rebukes of conscience and with other chastisements.&nbsp;
You all understand, my brethren, that the man black of flesh but covered
with a white robe was no wayside seducer who met Christian and Hopeful
at that dangerous part of the road only and only on that high-minded
day.&nbsp; You know from yourselves surely that both Christian and Hopeful
carried that black but smooth-spoken man within themselves.&nbsp; The
Flatterer who led the two pilgrims so fatally wrong that day was just
their own heart taken out of their own bosom and personified and dramatised
by Bunyan&rsquo;s dramatic genius, and so made to walk and talk and
flatter and puff up outside of themselves till they came again to see
who in reality he was and whence he came,&mdash;that is to say, till
they were brought to see what they themselves still were, and would
always be, when they were left to themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did
you lie last night? asked the Shining One with the whip.&nbsp; With
the Shepherds on the Delectable Mountains, they answered.&nbsp; He asked
them then if they had not of those shepherds a note of direction for
the way?&nbsp; They answered, Yes.&nbsp; But did you not, said he, when
you were at a stand pluck out and read your note?&nbsp; They answered,
No.&nbsp; He asked them why?&nbsp; They said they forgot.&nbsp; He asked,
moreover if the shepherds did not bid them beware of the Flatterer?&nbsp;
They answered, Yes; but we did not imagine, said they, that this fine-spoken
man had been he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All good literature, both sacred and profane, both ancient and modern,
is full of the Flatterer.&nbsp; Let me not, protests Elihu in his powerful
speech in the book of Job, let me not accept any man&rsquo;s person;
neither let me give flattering titles unto man, lest in so doing my
Maker should soon take me away.&nbsp; And the Psalmist in his powerful
description of the wicked men of his day: There is no faithfulness in
their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an
open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.&nbsp; And again: They
speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they speak.&nbsp;
But the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
speaketh proud things.&nbsp; &ldquo;The perpetual hyperbole&rdquo; of
pure love becomes in the lips of impure love the impure bait that leads
the simple ones astray on the streets of the city as seen and heard
by the wise man out of his casement.&nbsp; My son, say unto wisdom,
Thou art my sister, and call understanding thy kinswoman; that they
may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth
thee with her words, which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth
the covenant of her God.&nbsp; And then in the same book of Hebrew aphorisms
we find this text which Bunyan puts on the margin of the page: &ldquo;A
man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now, before we leave the ancient world, if you would not think it
beneath the dignity of the place we are in, I would like to read to
you a passage out of a round-about paper written by a satirist of Greece
about the time of Ezra and Nehemiah in Jerusalem.&nbsp; You will easily
remark the difference of tone between the seriousness and pathos of
the Hebrew prophet and the light and chaffing touch of Theophrastus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Flatterer is a person,&rdquo; says that satirist of Greek
society, &ldquo;who will say to you as he walks with you, &lsquo;Do
you observe how people are looking at you?&nbsp; This happens to no
man in Athens but to you.&nbsp; A fine compliment was paid you yesterday
in the Porch.&nbsp; More than thirty persons were sitting there when
the question was started, Who is our foremost man?&nbsp; Every one mentioned
you first, and ended by coming back to your name.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Flatterer
will laugh also at your stalest joke, and will stuff his cloak into
his mouth as if he could not repress his amusement when you again tell
it.&nbsp; He will buy apples and pears and will give to your children
when you are by, and will kiss them all and will say, &lsquo;Chicks
of a good father.&rsquo;&nbsp; Also, when he assists at the purchase
of slippers he will declare that the foot is more shapely than the shoe.&nbsp;
He is the first of the guests to praise the wine and to say as he reclines
next the host, &lsquo;How delicate your fare always is&rsquo;; and taking
up something from the table, &lsquo;Now, how excellent that is!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so on.&nbsp; Yes, we have heard it all over and over again in Modern
Athens also.&nbsp; The Greek fable also of the fox and the crow and
the piece of cheese is only another illustration of the truth that the
God of truth and integrity never left Himself without a witness.&nbsp;
Our own literature also is scattered full of the Flatterer and his too
willing dupes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of praise a mere glutton,&rdquo; says Goldsmith
of David Garrick, &ldquo;he swallowed what came.&nbsp; The puff of a
dunce he mistook it for fame.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Delicious essence,&rdquo;
exclaims Sterne, &ldquo;how refreshing thou art to poor human nature!&nbsp;
How sweetly dost thou mix with the blood, and help it through the most
difficult and tortuous passages to the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
that slanders me,&rdquo; says Cowper, &ldquo;paints me blacker than
I am, and he that flatters me whiter.&nbsp; They both daub me, and when
I look in the glass of conscience, I see myself disguised by both.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then he sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The worth of these three kingdoms I defy<br />
To lure me to the baseness of a lie;<br />
And of all lies (be that one poet&rsquo;s boast),<br />
The lie that flatters I abhor the most.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, praise, which is one of the best and sweetest things in human
life, so soon passes over into flattery, which is one of the worst things,
that something must here be said and laid to heart about praise also.&nbsp;
But, to begin with, praise itself must first be praised.&nbsp; There
is nothing nobler than true praise in him who speaks it, and there is
nothing dearer and sweeter to him who hears it.&nbsp; God Himself inhabits
the praises of Israel.&nbsp; All God&rsquo;s works praise Him.&nbsp;
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth Me.&nbsp; Praise waiteth for Thee,
O God, in Zion.&nbsp; Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into
His courts with praise.&nbsp; Violence shall no more be heard in thy
land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call
thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.&nbsp; And such also is all
true praise between man and man.&nbsp; How deliciously sweet is praise!&nbsp;
How we labour after it! how we look for it and wait for it! and how
we languish and die if we do not get it!&nbsp; Again, when it comes
to us, how it cheers us up and makes our face to shine!&nbsp; For a
long time after it our step is so swift on the street and our face beams
so that all men can quite well see what has come to us.&nbsp; Praise
is like wine in our blood; it is new life to our fainting heart.&nbsp;
So much is this the case that a salutation of praise is to be our first
taste of heaven itself.&nbsp; It will wipe all tears off our eyes when
we hear our Lord saying to us, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; when all our
good works that we have done in the body shall be found unto praise
and honour and glory in the great day of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>At the same time, this same love of praise is one of our most besetting
and fatal temptations as long as we are in this false and double and
deceptive world.&nbsp; Sin, God curse it! has corrupted and poisoned
everything, the very best things of this life, and when the best things
are corrupted and poisoned they become the worst things.&nbsp; And praise
does not escape this universal and fatal law.&nbsp; Weak, evil, and
self-seeking men are near us, and we lean upon them, look to them, and
listen to them.&nbsp; We make them our strength and support, and seek
repose and refreshment from them.&nbsp; They cannot be all or any of
these things to us; but we are far on in life, we are done with life,
before we have discovered that and will admit that.&nbsp; Most men never
discover and admit that till they are out of this life altogether.&nbsp;
Christ&rsquo;s praise and the applause of His saints and angels are
so future and so far away from us, and man&rsquo;s praise and the applause
of this world, hollow and false as it is, is so near us, that we feed
our souls on offal and garbage, when, already, in the witness of a good
conscience, we might be feasting our souls on the finest of the wheat,
and satisfying them with honey out of the rock.&nbsp; And, then, this
insatiable appetite of our hearts, being so degraded and perverted,
like all degraded and perverted appetites, becomes an iron-fast slave
to what it feeds upon.&nbsp; What miserable slaves we all are to the
approval and the praise of men!&nbsp; How they hold us in their bondage!&nbsp;
How we lick their hands and sit up on our haunches and go through our
postures for a crumb!&nbsp; How we crawl on our belly and lick their
feet for a stroke and a smile!&nbsp; What a hound&rsquo;s life does
that man lead who lives upon the approval and the praise and the patronage
of men!&nbsp; What meanness fills his mind; what baseness fills his
heart!&nbsp; What a shameful leash he is led about the world in!&nbsp;
How kicked about and spat upon he is; while not half so much as he knows
all the time that he deserves to be!&nbsp; Better far be a dog at once
and bay the moon than be a man and fawn upon the praises of men.</p>
<p>If you would be a man at all, not to speak of a Christian man, starve
this appetite till you have quite extirpated it.&nbsp; You will never
be safe from it as long as it stirs within you.&nbsp; Extirpate it!&nbsp;
Extirpate it!&nbsp; You will never know true self-respect and you will
never deserve to know it, till you have wholly extirpated your appetite
for praise.&nbsp; Put your foot upon it, put it out of your heart.&nbsp;
Stop fishing for it, and when you see it coming, turn away and stop
your ears against it.&nbsp; And should it still insinuate itself, at
any rate do not repeat to others what has already so flattered and humbled
and weakened you.&nbsp; Telling it to others will only humble and weaken
you more.&nbsp; By repeating the praise that you have heard or read
about yourself you only expose yourself and purchase well-deserved contempt
for yourself.&nbsp; And, more than that, by fishing for praise you lay
yourself open to all sorts of flatterers.&nbsp; Honest men, men who
truly respect and admire you, will show you their dignified regard and
appreciation of you and your work by their silence; while your leaky
slaves will crowd around you with floods of praise that they know well
will please and purchase you.&nbsp; And when you cannot with all your
arts squeeze a drop out of those who love and honour you, gallons will
be poured upon you by those who have respect neither for themselves
nor for you.&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp; Flee from flatterers, and take up only
with sternly true and faithful men.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am much less regardful,&rdquo;
says Richard Baxter, &ldquo;of the approbation of men, and set much
lighter store by their praise and their blame, than I once did.&nbsp;
All worldly things appear most vain and unsatisfying to those who have
tried them most.&nbsp; But while I feel that this has had some hand
in my distaste for man&rsquo;s praise, yet it is the increasing impression
on my heart of man&rsquo;s nothingness and God&rsquo;s transcendent
greatness; it is the brevity and vanity of all earthly things, taken
along with the nearness of eternity;&mdash;it is all this that has at
last lifted me above the blame and the praise of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To conclude; let us make up our mind and determine to pass on to
God on the spot every syllable of praise that ever comes to our eyes
or our ears&mdash;if, in this cold, selfish, envious, and grudging world,
any syllable of praise ever should come to us.&nbsp; Even if pure and
generous and well-deserved praise should at any time come to us, all
that does not make it ours.&nbsp; The best earned usury is not the steward&rsquo;s
own money to do with it what he likes.&nbsp; The principal and the interest,
and the trader too, are all his master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And, more than
that, after the wisest and the best trader has done his best, he will
remain, to himself at least, a most unprofitable servant.&nbsp; Pass
on then immediately, dutifully, and to its very last syllable, to God
all the praise that comes to you.&nbsp; Wash your hands of it and say,
Not unto us, O God, not unto us, but unto Thy name.&nbsp; And then,
to take the most selfish and hungry-hearted view of this whole matter,
what you thus pass on to God as not your own but His, He will soon,
and in a better and safer world, return again to the full with usury
to you, and you again to God, and He again to you, and so on, all down
the pure and true and sweet and blessed life of heaven.</p>
<h2>ATHEIST</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo; . . . without God [literally, atheists] in the
world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder is a man with his back toward Zion, and he is coming
to meet us.&nbsp; So he drew nearer and nearer, and at last came up
to them.&nbsp; His name was Atheist, and he asked them whither they
were going?&nbsp; We are going to the Mount Zion, they answered.&nbsp;
Then Atheist fell into a very great laughter.&nbsp; What is the meaning
of your laughter? they asked.&nbsp; I laugh to see what ignorant persons
you are to take upon you so tedious a journey, and yet are like to have
nothing but your travel for your pains.&nbsp; Why, man?&nbsp; Do you
think we shall not be received? they said.&nbsp; Received!&nbsp; There
is no such place as you dream of in all this world.&nbsp; But there
is in the world to come, replied Christian.&nbsp; When I was at home,
Atheist went on, in mine own country I heard as you now affirm, and,
from that hearing, I went out to see, and have been seeking this city
you speak of this twenty years, but find no more of it than I did the
first day I set out.&nbsp; And, still laughing, he went his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having begun to tell us about Atheist, why did Bunyan not tell us
more?&nbsp; We would have thanked him warmly to-night for a little more
about this unhappy man.&nbsp; Why did the dreamer not take another eight
or ten pages in order to tell us, as only he could have told us, how
this man that is now Atheist had spent his past twenty years seeking
Mount Zion?&nbsp; Those precious unwritten pages are now buried in John
Strudwick&rsquo;s vault in Bunhill Fields, and no other man has arisen
able to handle Bunyan&rsquo;s biographic pen.&nbsp; Had Bunyan but put
off the entrance of Christian and Hopeful into the city till he had
told us something more about the twenty years it had taken this once
earnest pilgrim to become an atheist, how valuable an interpolation
that would have been!&nbsp; What was it that made this man to set out
so long ago for the Celestial City?&nbsp; What was it that so stoutly
determined him to leave off all his old companions and turn his back
on the sweet refreshments of his youth?&nbsp; How did he do at the Slough
of Despond?&nbsp; Did he come that way?&nbsp; What about the Wicket
Gate, and the House Beautiful, and the Interpreter&rsquo;s House, and
the Delectable Mountains?&nbsp; What men, and especially what women,
did he meet and converse with on his way?&nbsp; What were his fortunes,
and what his misfortunes?&nbsp; How much did he lay out at Vanity Fair,
and on what?&nbsp; At what point of his twenty years&rsquo; way did
his youthful faith begin to shake, and his youthful love begin to become
lukewarm?&nbsp; And what was it that at last made him quite turn round
his back on Zion and his face to his own country?&nbsp; I cannot forgive
Bunyan to-night for not telling us the story of Atheist&rsquo;s conversion,
his pilgrimage, and his apostasy in full.</p>
<p>At the same time, though it cannot be denied that Bunyan has lost
at this point a great opportunity for his genius and for our advantage,&mdash;at
the same time, he undoubtedly did a very courageous thing in introducing
Atheist at all; and, especially, in introducing him to us and making
him laugh so loudly at us when we are on the very borders of the land
of Beulah.&nbsp; A less courageous writer, and a writer less sure of
his ground, would have left out Atheist altogether; or, if he had felt
constrained to introduce him, would have introduced him at any other
period of our history rather than at this period.&nbsp; Under other
hands than Bunyan&rsquo;s we would have met with this mocking reprobate
just outside the City of Destruction; or, perhaps, among the booths
of Vanity Fair; or, indeed, anywhere but where we now meet him.&nbsp;
And, that our greater-minded author does not let loose the laughter
of Atheist upon us till we are almost out of the body is a stroke of
skill and truth and boldness that makes us glad indeed that we possess
such a sketch at Bunyan&rsquo;s hand at all, all too abrupt and all
too short as that sketch is.&nbsp; In the absence, then, of a full-length
and finished portrait of Atheist, we must be content to fall back on
some of the reflections and lessons that the mere mention of his name,
the spot he passes us on, and the ridicule of his laughter, all taken
together, awaken in our minds.&nbsp; One rapid stroke of such a brush
as that of John Bunyan conveys more to us than a full-length likeness,
with all the strongest colours, of any other artist would be able to
do.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; One thing the life-long admiration of John Bunyan&rsquo;s
books has helped to kindle and burn into my mind and my imagination
is this: What a universe of things is the heart of man!&nbsp; Were there
nothing else in the heart of man but all the places and all the persons
and all the adventures that John Bunyan saw in his sleep, what a world
that would open up in all our bosoms!&nbsp; All the pilgrims, good and
bad&mdash;they, or the seed and possibility of them all, are all in
your heart and in mine.&nbsp; All the cities, all the roads that lead
from one city to another, with all the paths and all the by-paths,&mdash;all
the adventures, experiences, endurances, conflicts, overthrows, victories,&mdash;all
are within us and never are to be seen anywhere else.&nbsp; Heaven and
hell, God and the devil, life and death, salvation and damnation, time
and eternity, all are within us.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no Mount Zion
in all this world,&rdquo; bellowed out this blinded fool.&nbsp; &ldquo;No;
I know that quite well,&rdquo; quickly responded Christian; &ldquo;but
there is in the world to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have said the whole
truth, and he would have been entirely right, had he taken time to add,
&ldquo;and in the world within.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And more,&rdquo;
he should have said to Atheist, &ldquo;much more in the world within
than in any possible world to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Celestial City,
every Sabbath-school child begins gradually to understand, is not up
among the stars; till, as he grows older, he takes in the whole of the
New Testament truth that the kingdom of heaven is wholly within him.&nbsp;
You all understand, my brethren, that were we swept in a moment up to
the furthest star, by all that infinite flight we would not be one hair&rsquo;s-breadth
nearer the heavenly city.&nbsp; That is not the right direction to that
city.&nbsp; The city whose builder and maker is God lies in quite a
different direction from that altogether; not by ascending up beyond
sun and moon and stars to all eternity would we ever get one hand&rsquo;s-breadth
nearer God.&nbsp; But if you deny yourself sleep to-night till you have
read His book and bowed your knees in His closet; if, for His sake,
you deny yourself to-morrow when you are eating and drinking; as often
as you say, &ldquo;Not my will, but Thine be done&rdquo;; as often as
you humble yourself when others exalt themselves; as often as you refuse
praise and despise blame for His sake; as often as you forgive before
God your enemy, and rejoice with your friend,&mdash;Behold! the kingdom
of heaven, with its King and all His shining court of angels and saints
is around you;&mdash;is, indeed, within you.&nbsp; No; there is no such
place.&nbsp; Heaven is not in any place: heaven is in a person where
it is at all; and you are that person as often as you put off an earthly
and put on a heavenly mind.&nbsp; That mocking reprobate, with his secret
heart all through those twenty years hungering after the lusts of his
youth,&mdash;he was wholly right in what he so unintentionally said;
there is no such place in all this world.&nbsp; And, even if there were,
it would spue him and all who are like him out of its mouth.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And, then, in all that universe of things that fills that
bottomless pit and shoreless sea the human heart, there is nothing deeper
down in it than just its deep and unsearchable atheism.&nbsp; The very
deepest thing, and the most absolutely inexpugnable thing, in every
human heart is its theism; its original and inextinguishable convictions
about itself and about God.&nbsp; But, all but as deep as that&mdash;for
all around that, and all over that, and soaking all through that&mdash;there
lies a superincumbent mass of sullen, brutish, malignant atheism.&nbsp;
Nay, so deep down is the atheism of all our hearts, that it is only
one here and another there of the holiest and the ripest of God&rsquo;s
saints who ever get down to it, or even get at their deepest within
sight of it.&nbsp; Robert Fleming tells us about Robert Bruce, that
he was a man that had much inward exercise about his own personal case,
and had been often assaulted anent that great foundation truth, if there
was a God.&nbsp; And often, when he had come up to the pulpit, after
being some time silent, which was his usual way, he would say, &ldquo;I
think it is a great matter to believe there is a God&rdquo;; telling
the people that it was another thing to believe that than they judged.&nbsp;
But it was also known to his friends what extraordinary confirmations
he had from the Lord therein, and what near familiarity he did attain
to in his heart-converse with God: Yea, truly, adds Fleming, some things
I have had thereanent that seem so strange and marvellous that I forbear
to set them down.&nbsp; And in Halyburton&rsquo;s priceless <i>Memoirs</i>
we read: &ldquo;Hereby I was brought into a doubt about the truths of
religion, the being of God, and things eternal.&nbsp; Whenever I was
in dangers or straits and would build upon these things, a suspicion
secretly haunted me, what if the things are not?&nbsp; This perplexity
was somewhat eased while one day I was reading how Robert Bruce was
shaken about the being of God, and how at length he came to the fullest
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in another place: &ldquo;Some days ago
reading Ex. ix. and x., and finding this, &lsquo;That ye may know that
I am God&rsquo; frequently repeated, and elsewhere in passages innumerable,
as the end of God&rsquo;s manifesting Himself in His word and works;
I observe from it that atheism is deeply rooted even in the Lord&rsquo;s
people, seeing they need to be taught this so much.&nbsp; The great
difficulty that the whole of revelation has to grapple with is atheism;
its whole struggle is to recover man to his first impressions of a God.&nbsp;
This one point comprehends the whole of man&rsquo;s recovery, just as
atheism is the whole of man&rsquo;s apostasy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, again,
in another part of the same great book, Halyburton says: &ldquo;I must
observe, also, the wise providence of God, that the greatest difficulties
that lie against religion are hid from atheists.&nbsp; All the objections
I meet with in their writings are not nearly so subtle as those which
are often suggested to myself.&nbsp; The reason of this is obvious from
the very nature of the thing&mdash;such persons take not a near-hand
view of religion, and while persons stand at a distance neither are
the advantages nor the difficulties of religion discerned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now listen to Bunyan, that arch-atheist: &ldquo;Whole floods of
blasphemies both against God, Christ, and the Scriptures were poured
upon my spirit, to my great confusion and astonishment.&nbsp; Against
the very being of God and of His only beloved Son; or, whether there
were, in truth, a God and a Christ, or no.&nbsp; Of all the temptations
that ever I met with in my life, to question the being of God and the
truth of the Gospel is the worst, and the worst to be borne.&nbsp; When
this temptation comes it takes away my girdle from me, and removeth
the foundation from under me.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fool, said my Muse to me, look in thy heart and
write.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And John Bunyan looked into his own deep and holy heart, and out
of it he composed this incident of Atheist.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It may not be out of place at this point to look for a moment
at some of the things that agitate, stir up, and make the secret atheism
of our hearts to fluctuate and overflow.&nbsp; Butler has a fine passage
in which he points out that it is only the higher class of minds that
are tempted with speculative difficulties such as those were that assaulted
Christian and Hopeful after they were so near the end of their journey.&nbsp;
Coarse, commonplace, and mean-minded men have their probation appointed
them among coarse, mean, and commonplace things; whereas enlightened,
enlarged, and elevated men are exercised after the manner of Robert
Bruce, Thomas Halyburton, John Bunyan, and Butler himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
chief temptations of the generality of the world are the ordinary motives
to injustice or unrestrained pleasure; but there are other persons without
this shallowness of temper; persons of a deeper sense as to what is
invisible and future.&nbsp; Now, these persons have their moral discipline
set them in that high region.&rdquo;&nbsp; The profound bishop means
that while their appetites and their tempers are the stumbling-stones
of the most of men, the difficult problems of natural and revealed and
experimental religion are the test and the triumph of other men.&nbsp;
As we have just seen in the men mentioned above.&nbsp; Students, whose
temptations lie fully as much in their intellects as in their senses,
should buy (for a few pence) Halyburton&rsquo;s Memoirs.&nbsp; &ldquo;With
Halyburton,&rdquo; says Dr. John Duncan, &ldquo;I feel great intellectual
congruity.&nbsp; Halyburton was naturally a sceptic, but God gave that
sceptic great faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again, what Atheist calls the &ldquo;tediousness&rdquo; of the
journey has undoubtedly a great hand in making some half-in-earnest
men sceptics, if not scoffers.&nbsp; Many of us here to-night who can
never now take this miserable man&rsquo;s way out of the tedium of the
Christian life, yet most bitterly feel it.&nbsp; Whether that tedium
is inherent in that life, and inevitable to such men as we are who are
attempting that life; how far that feature belongs to the very essence
of the pilgrim life, and how far we import our own tedium into the pilgrimage;
the fact remains as Atheist puts it.&nbsp; As Atheist in this book says,
so the Atheist who is in our hearts often says: We are like to have
nothing for all our pains but a lifetime of tedious travel.&nbsp; Yes,
wherever the blame lies, there can be no doubt about it, that what this
hilarious scoffer calls the tediousness of the way is but a too common
experience among many of those who, tediousness and all, will still
cleave fast to it and will never leave it.</p>
<p>Then, again, great trials in life, great straits, dark and too-long-continued
providences, prayer unanswered, or not yet answered in the way we dictate,
bad men and bad causes growing like a green bay tree, and good men and
good work languishing and dying; these things, and many more things
such as these, of which this world of faith and patience is full, prove
quite too much for some men till they give themselves up to a state
of mind that is nothing better than atheism.&nbsp; &ldquo;My evidences
and my certainty,&rdquo; says Halyburton, &ldquo;were not answerable
to the weight I was compelled to lay upon them.&rdquo;&nbsp; A figure
which Goodwin in his own tender and graphic way takes up thus: &ldquo;Set
pins in a wall and fix them in ever so loosely, yet, if you hang nothing
upon them they will seem to stand firm; but hang a heavy weight upon
them, or even give them the least jog as you pass, and the whole thing
will suddenly come down.&nbsp; The wall is God&rsquo;s word, the slack
pin is our faith, and the weight and the jog are the heavy burdens and
the sudden shocks of life, and down our hearts go, wall and pin and
suspended vessel and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the church and her ministers, when the Scriptures and their
anomalies, and when the faults and failings of Christian men are made
the subject of mockery and laughter, the reverence, the fear, the awe,
the respect that all enter so largely into religion, and especially
into the religion of young people, is too easily destroyed; and not
seldom the first seeds of practical and sometimes of speculative atheism
are thus sown.&nbsp; The mischief that has been done by mockery and
laughter to the souls, especially of the young and the inexperienced,
only the great day will fully disclose.</p>
<p>And then, two men of great weight and authority with us, tell us
what we who are ministers would have found out without them: this, namely,
that the greatest atheists are they who are ever handling holy things
without feeling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; said Christian to Hopeful, his fellow,
&ldquo;is it true what this man hath said?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
heed,&rdquo; said Hopeful, &ldquo;remember what it hath cost us already
for hearkening to such kind of fellows.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; No Mount Zion!&nbsp;
Did we not see from the Delectable Mountains the gate of the City?&nbsp;
And, besides, are we not to walk by faith?&nbsp; Let us go on lest the
man with the whip overtakes us again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christian: &ldquo;My
brother, I said that but to prove thee, and to fetch from thee a fruit
of the honesty of thy heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many a deep and powerful passage
has Butler composed on that thesis which Hopeful here supplies him with;
and many a brilliant sermon has Newman preached on that same text till
he has made our &ldquo;predispositions to faith&rdquo; a fruitful and
an ever fresh commonplace to hundreds of preachers.&nbsp; Yes; the best
bulwark of faith is a good and honest heart.&nbsp; To such a happy heart
the truth is its own unshaken evidence.&nbsp; To whom can we go but
to Thee?&mdash;they who have such a heart protest.&nbsp; The whole bent
of such men&rsquo;s minds is toward the truth of the gospel.&nbsp; Their
instincts keep them on the right way even when their reason and their
observation are both confounded.&nbsp; As Newman keeps on saying, they
are &ldquo;easy of belief.&rdquo;&nbsp; They cannot keep away from Christ
and His church.&nbsp; They cannot turn back.&nbsp; They must go on.&nbsp;
Though He slay them they will die yearning after Him.&nbsp; They often
fall into great error and into great guilt, but their seed remaineth
in them, and they cannot continue in error or in guilt, because they
are born of God.&nbsp; They are they in whom</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Persuasion and belief<br />
Have ripened into faith; and faith become<br />
A passionate intuition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>HOPEFUL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are saved by hope.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up till the time when Christian and Faithful passed through Vanity
Fair on their way to the Celestial City, Hopeful was one of the most
light-minded men in all that light-minded town.&nbsp; By his birth,
and both on his father&rsquo;s and his mother&rsquo;s side, Hopeful
was, to begin with, a youth of an unusually shallow and silly mind.&nbsp;
In the jargon of our day he was a man of a peculiarly optimistic temperament.&nbsp;
No one ever blamed him for being too subjective and introspective.&nbsp;
It took many sharp trials and many bitter disappointments to take the
inborn frivolity and superficiality out of this young man&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
He was far on in his life, he was far on even in his religious life,
before you would have ever thought of calling him a serious-minded man.&nbsp;
Hopeful had been born and brought up to early manhood in the town of
Vanity, and he knew nothing better and desired nothing better than to
lay out his whole life and to rest all his hopes on the things of the
fair; on such things, that is, as houses, lands, places, honours, preferments,
titles, pleasures, and delights of all sorts.&nbsp; And that vain and
empty life went on with him, till, as he told his companion afterwards,
it had all ended with him in revelling, and drinking, and uncleanness,
and Sabbath-breaking, and all such things as destroyed his soul.&nbsp;
But in Hopeful&rsquo;s happy case also the blood of the martyrs became
the seed of the church.&nbsp; Hopeful, as he was afterwards called,
had suffered so many bitter disappointments and shipwrecks of expectation
from the things of the fair, that is to say, from the houses, the places,
the preferments, the pleasures and what not, of the fair, that even
his heart was ripe for something better than any of those things, when,
as God would have it, Christian and Faithful came to the town.&nbsp;
Hopeful was still hanging about the booths of the fair; he was just
fingering his last sixpence over a commodity that he knew quite well
would be like gall in his belly as soon as he had bought it; when,&mdash;what
is that hubbub that rolls down the street?&nbsp; Hopeful was always
the first to see and to hear every new thing that came to the town,
and thus it was that he was soon in the thick of the tumult that rose
around Christian and Faithful.&nbsp; Had those two pilgrims come to
the town at any former time, Hopeful would have been among the foremost
to mock at and smite the two men; but, to-day, Hopeful&rsquo;s heart
is so empty, and his purse also, that he is already won to their side
by the loving looks and the wise and sweet words of the two ill-used
men.&nbsp; Some of the men of the town said that the two pilgrims were
outlandish and bedlamite men, but Hopeful took courage to reprove some
of the foremost of the mob.&nbsp; Till, at last, when Faithful was at
the stake, it was all that his companions could do to keep back Hopeful
from leaping up on the burning pile and embracing the expiring man.&nbsp;
And then, when He who overrules all things so brought it about that
Christian escaped out of their hands, who should come forth and join
him at the upward gate of the city but just Hopeful, who not only joined
himself to the lonely pilgrim, but told him also that there were many
more of the men of the city who would take their time and follow after.&nbsp;
And thus, adds his biographer, when one died to make his testimony to
the truth, another rose up out of his ashes to be a companion to Christian.</p>
<p>When Madame Krudener was getting her foot measured by a pietist shoemaker,
she was so struck with the repose and the sweetness and the heavenly
joy of the poor man&rsquo;s look and manner that she could not help
but ask him what had happened to him that he had such a look on his
countenance and such a light in his eye.&nbsp; She was miserable, though
she had all that heart could wish.&nbsp; She had all that made her one
of the most envied women in Europe; she had birth, talents, riches,
rank, and the friendship of princes and princesses, and yet she was
of all women the most miserable.&nbsp; And here was a poor chance shoemaker
whose whole heart was running over with a joy such that all her wealth
could not purchase to her heart one single drop of it.&nbsp; The simple
soul soon told her his secret; it was no secret: it was just Jesus Christ
who had done it all.&nbsp; And thus her poor shoemaker&rsquo;s happy
face was the means of this great lady&rsquo;s conversion.&nbsp; And,
in like manner, it was the beholding of Christian and Faithful in their
words and in their behaviour at the fair that decided Hopeful to join
himself to Christian and henceforth to be his companion.</p>
<p>What were the things, asked Christian of his young companion, that
first led you to leave off the vanities of the fair and to think to
be a pilgrim?&nbsp; Many things, replied Hopeful.&nbsp; Sometimes if
I did but meet a good man in the street.&nbsp; Or if mine head began
unaccountably, or mine heart, to ache.&nbsp; Or if some one of my companions
became suddenly sick.&nbsp; Or if I heard the bell toll that some one
was dead.&nbsp; But, especially, when I thought of myself that I must
quickly come to judgment.&nbsp; And then it is told in the best style
of the book how peace and rest and the beginning of true satisfaction
came to poor Hopeful&rsquo;s heart at last.&nbsp; But you must promise
me to read the passage for yourselves before you sleep to-night; and
to read it again and again till, like Hopeful&rsquo;s, your heart also
is full of joy, and your eyes full of tears, and your affections running
over with love to the name and to the people and to all the ways of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And then, it is very encouraging and reassuring to us to see how
Hopeful&rsquo;s true conversion so deepened and sobered and strengthened
his whole character.&nbsp; He remained to the end in his mental constitution
and whole temperament, as we say, the same man he had always been; but,
while remaining the same man, at the same time a most wonderful change
gradually began to come over him, till, by slow but sure degrees, he
became the Hopeful we know and look to and lean upon.&nbsp; To use his
own autobiographic words about himself, it was &ldquo;by hearing and
considering of things that are Divine&rdquo; that his natural levity
was so completely whipped out of his soul till he was made at last an
indispensable companion to Christian, strong-minded and serious-minded
man as he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Conversion to God,&rdquo; says William Law,
&ldquo;is often very sudden and instantaneous, unexpectedly raised from
variety of occasions.&nbsp; Thus, one by seeing only a withered tree,
another by reading the lives and deaths of the antediluvian fathers,
one by hearing of heaven, another of hell, one by reading of the love
or wrath of God, another of the sufferings of Christ, may find himself,
as it were, melted into penitence all of a sudden.&nbsp; It may be granted
also that the greatest sinner may in a moment be converted to God, and
may feel himself wounded in such a degree as perhaps those never were
who have been turning to God all their lives.&nbsp; But, then, it is
to be observed that this suddenness of change or flash of conviction
is by no means of the essence of true conversion.&nbsp; This stroke
of conversion is not to be considered as signifying our high state of
a new birth in Christ, or a proof that we are on a sudden made new creatures,
but that we are thus suddenly called upon and stirred up to look after
a newness of nature.&nbsp; The renewal of our first birth and state
is something entirely distinct from our first sudden conversion and
call to repentance.&nbsp; That is not a thing done in an instant, but
is a certain process, a gradual release from our captivity and disorder,
consisting of several stages and degrees, both of life and death, which
the soul must go through before it can have thoroughly put off the old
man.&nbsp; It is well worth observing that our Saviour&rsquo;s greatest
trials were near the end of His life.&nbsp; This might sufficiently
show us that our first awakenings have carried us but a little way;
that we should not then begin to be self-assured of our own salvation,
but should remember that we stand at a great distance from, and are
in great ignorance of, our severest trials.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the
way that Christian in his experience and in his wisdom talked to his
young companion till his outward trials and the consequent discoveries
he made of his own weakness and corruption made even Hopeful himself
a sober-minded and a thoughtful man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where pain ends, gain
ends too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, again, no one can read Hopeful&rsquo;s remarkable history without
discovering this about him, that he showed best in adversity and distress,
just as he showed worst in deliverance and prosperity.&nbsp; It is a
fine lesson in Christian hope to descend into Giant Despair&rsquo;s
dungeon and hear the older pilgrim groaning and the younger pilgrim
consoling him, and, again, to stand on the bank of the last river and
hear Hopeful holding up Christian&rsquo;s drowning head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
of good cheer, my brother, for I feel the bottom, and it is good!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Bless Hopeful for that, all you whose deathbeds are still before you.&nbsp;
For never was more true and fit word spoken for a dying hour than that.&nbsp;
Read, till you have it by heart and in the dark, Hopeful&rsquo;s whole
history, but especially his triumphant end.&nbsp; And have some one
bespoken beforehand to read Hopeful in the River to you when you have
in a great measure lost your senses, and when a great horror has taken
hold of your mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sink in deep waters,&rdquo; cried
Christian, as his sins came to his mind, even the sins which he had
committed both since and before he came to be a pilgrim.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I see the gate,&rdquo; said Hopeful, &ldquo;and men standing at it ready
to receive us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Read to me where I first cast my
anchor,&rdquo; said John Knox to his weeping wife.</p>
<p>The Enchanted Ground, on the other hand, threatened to throw Hopeful
back again into his former light-minded state.&nbsp; And there is no
saying what shipwreck he might have made there had the older man not
been with him to steady and reprove and instruct him.&nbsp; As it was,
a touch now and then of his old vain temper returned to him till it
took all his companion&rsquo;s watchfulness and wariness to carry them
both out of that second Vanity Fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I acknowledge myself
in a fault,&rdquo; said Hopeful to Christian, &ldquo;and had I been
here alone I had run in danger of death.&nbsp; Hitherto, thy company
hath been my mercy, and thou shalt have a good reward for all thy labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, my brethren, in my opinion we owe a great debt of gratitude
to John Bunyan for the large and the displayed place he has given to
Hopeful in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; The fulness and
balance and proportion of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> are features
of that wonderful book far too much overlooked.&nbsp; So far as my reading
goes I do not know any other author who has at all done the justice
to the saving grace of hope that John Bunyan has done both in his doctrinal
and in his allegorical works.&nbsp; Bunyan stands alone and supreme
not only for the insight, and the power with which he has constructed
the character and the career of Hopeful, but even for having given him
the space at all adequate to his merits and his services.&nbsp; In those
eighty-seven so suggestive pages that form the index to Dr. Thomas Goodwin&rsquo;s
works I find some hundred and twenty-four references to &ldquo;faith,&rdquo;
while there are only two references to &ldquo;hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
that same oversight and neglect runs through all our religious literature,
and I suppose, as a consequence, through all our preaching too.&nbsp;
Now that is not the treatment the Bible gives to this so essential Christian
grace, as any one may see at a glance who takes the trouble to turn
up his Cruden.&nbsp; Hope has a great place alongside of faith and love
in the Holy Scriptures, and it has a correspondingly large and eloquent
place in Bunyan.&nbsp; Now, that being so, why is it that this so great
and so blessed grace has so fallen out of our sermons and out of our
hearts?&nbsp; May God grant that our reading of Hopeful&rsquo;s autobiography
and his subsequent history to-night may do something to restore the
blessed grace of hope to its proper place both in our pulpit and in
all our hearts.</p>
<p>To kindle then, to quicken, and to anchor your hope, my brethren,
may I have God&rsquo;s help to speak for a little longer to your hearts
concerning this neglected grace!&nbsp; For, what is hope?&nbsp; Hope
is a passion of the soul, wise or foolish, to be ashamed of or to be
proud of, just according to the thing hoped for, and just according
to the grounds of the hope.&nbsp; Hope is made up of these two ingredients&mdash;desire
and expectation.&nbsp; What we greatly desire we take no rest till we
find good grounds on which to build up our expectations of it; and when
we have found good grounds for our expectations, then a glad hope takes
possession of our hearts.&nbsp; Now, to begin with, how is it with your
desires?&nbsp; You are afraid to say much about your expectations and
your hopes.&nbsp; Well; let us come to your hearts&rsquo; desires.&mdash;Men
of God, I will enter into your hearts and I will tell you your hearts&rsquo;
desires better than you know them yourselves; for the heart is deceitful
above all things.&nbsp; The time was, when, like this young pilgrim
before he became a pilgrim, your desires were all set on houses, and
lands, and places, and honours, and preferments, and wives, and children,
and silver, and gold, and what not.&nbsp; These things at one time were
the utmost limit of your desires.&nbsp; But that has all been changed.&nbsp;
For now you have begun to desire a better city, that is, an heavenly.&nbsp;
What is your chief desire for this New Year? <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is it not a new heart?&nbsp; Is it not a clean heart?&nbsp; Is it not
a holy heart?&nbsp; Is it not that the Holy Ghost would write the golden
rule on the tables of your heart?&nbsp; Does not God know that it is
the deepest desire of your heart to be able to love your neighbour as
yourself?&nbsp; To be able to rejoice with him in his joy as well as
to weep with him in his sorrow?&nbsp; What would you not give never
again to feel envy in your heart at your brother, or straitness and
pining at his prosperity?&nbsp; One thing do I desire, said the Psalmist,
that mine ear may be nailed to the doorpost of my God: that I may always
be His servant, and may never wander from His service.&nbsp; Now, that
is your desire too.&nbsp; I am sure it is.&nbsp; You would not say it
of yourself, but I defy you to deny it when it is said about you.&nbsp;
Well, then, such things being found among your desires, what grounds
have you for expecting the fulfilment of such desires?&nbsp; What grounds?&nbsp;
The best of grounds and every ground.&nbsp; For you have the sure ground
of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; And you have more than His word: you have
His very nature, and the very nature of things.&nbsp; For shall God
create such desires in any man&rsquo;s heart only to starve and torture
that man?&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; It were blasphemy to suspect it.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; Where God has made any man to be so far a partaker of the
Divine nature as to change all that man&rsquo;s deepest desires, and
to turn them from vanity to wisdom, from earth to heaven, and from the
creature to the Creator, doubt not, wherever He has begun such a work,
that He will hasten to finish it.&nbsp; Yes; lift up your heavy hearts,
all ye who desire such things, for God hath sent His Son to say to you,
Blessed are ye that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for ye shall
be filled.&nbsp; Only, keep desiring.&nbsp; Desire every day with a
stronger and a more inconsolable desire.&nbsp; Desire, and ground your
desire on God&rsquo;s word, and then heave your hope like an anchor
within the veil whither the Forerunner is for you entered.&nbsp; May
I so hope? you say.&nbsp; May I venture to hope?&nbsp; Yes; not only
may you hope, but you must hope.&nbsp; You are commanded to hope.&nbsp;
It is as much your bounden duty to hope always, and to hope for the
greatest and best things, as it is to repent of your sins, to love God
and your neighbour, to keep yourself pure, and to set a watch on the
door of your lips.&nbsp; You have been destroyed, I confess and lament
it, for lack of knowledge about the nature, the grounds, and the duty
of hope.&nbsp; But make up now for past neglect.&nbsp; Hope steadfastly,
hope constantly, hope boldly; hope for the best things, the greatest
things, the most divine and the most blessed things.&nbsp; If you forget
to-night all else you have heard to-day, I implore you not any longer
to forget and neglect this, that hope is your immediate, constant, imperative
duty.&nbsp; No sin, no depth of corruption in your heart, no assault
on your heart from your conscience, can justify you in ceasing to hope.&nbsp;
Even when trouble &ldquo;comes tumbling over the neck of all your reformations&rdquo;
as it came tumbling on Hopeful, let that only drive you the more deeply
down into the true grounds of hope; even against hope rejoice in hope.&nbsp;
Remember the Psalmist in the hundred-and-thirtieth Psalm,&mdash;down
in the deeps, if ever a fallen sinner was.&nbsp; Yet hear him when you
cannot see him saying: I hope in Thy word!&nbsp; And&mdash;for it is
worthy to stand beside even that splendid psalm,&mdash;I beseech you
to read and lay to heart what Hopeful says about himself in his conversion
despair.</p>
<p>And then, as if to justify that hope, there always come with it such
sanctifying influences and such sure results.&nbsp; The hope that you
are one day to awaken in the Divine likeness will make you lie down
on your bed every night in self-examination, repentance, prayer, and
praise.&nbsp; The hope that your eyes are one day to see Christ as He
is will make you purify yourself as nothing else will.&nbsp; The hope
that you are to walk with Christ in white will make you keep your garments
clean; it will make you wash them many times every day in the blood
of the Lamb.&nbsp; The hope that you are to cast your crown at His feet
will make you watch that no man takes your crown from you.&nbsp; The
hope that you are to drink wine with Him in His Father&rsquo;s kingdom
will reconcile you meanwhile to water, lest with your wine you stumble
any of His little ones.&nbsp; The hope of hearing Him say, Well done!&mdash;how
that will make you labour and endure and not faint!&nbsp; And the hope
that you shall one day enter in through the gates into the city, and
have a right to the tree of life,&mdash;how scrupulous that will make
you to keep all His commandments!&nbsp; And this is one of His commandments,
that you gird up the loins of your mind, and hope to the end for the
grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2>TEMPORARY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They are they, which, when they hear, receive
the word with joy; and have no root, which for a while believe, and
in time of temptation fall away.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, did you not know about ten years ago one Temporary
in your parts who was a forward man in religion?&nbsp; Know him! replied
the other.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; For my house not being above three miles
from his house he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many tears.&nbsp;
Truly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without hope of him;
but one may see that it is not every one who cries Lord, Lord.&nbsp;
And now, since we are talking about him, let us a little inquire into
the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and such others.&nbsp; It
may be very profitable, said Christian, but do you begin.&nbsp; Well,
then, there are in my judgment several reasons for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then, with the older man&rsquo;s entire approval, Hopeful sets forth
several reasons, taken from his own observation of backsliders, why
so many men&rsquo;s religion is such a temporary thing; why so many
run well for a time, and then stand still, and then turn back.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The fear of man bringeth a snare, said Hopeful, moralising
over his old acquaintance Temporary.&nbsp; And how true that observation
is every evangelical minister knows to his deep disappointment.&nbsp;
A young man comes to his minister at some time of distress in his life,
or at some time of revival of religion in the community, or at an ordinary
communion season, and gives every sign that he is early and fairly embarked
on an honourable Christian life.&nbsp; He takes his place in the Church
of Christ, and he puts out his hand to her work, till we begin to look
forward with boastfulness to a life of great stability and great attainment
for that man.&nbsp; Our Lord, as we see from so many of His parables,
must have had many such cases among His first followers.&nbsp; Our Lord
might be speaking prophetically, as well as out of His own experience,
so well do His regretful and lamenting words fit into so many of our
own cases to-day.&nbsp; For, look at that young business man.&nbsp;
He has been born and brought up in the Church of Christ.&nbsp; He has
gladdened more hearts than he knows by the noble promise of his early
days.&nbsp; Many admiring and loving eyes have been turned on him as
he took so hopefully the upward way.&nbsp; But a sifting-time soon comes.&nbsp;
A time of temptation comes.&nbsp; A time comes when sides must be taken
in some moral, religious, ecclesiastical controversy.&nbsp; This young
man is at that moment a candidate for a post that will bring distinction,
wealth, and social influence to him who holds it.&nbsp; And the candidate
we are so much interested in is admittedly a man of such outstanding
talents that he would at once get the post were it not that the holder
of that post must not have his name so much associated with such and
such a church, such and such political and religious opinions, and such
and such public men.&nbsp; He is told that.&nbsp; Indeed, he is not
so dull as to need to be told that.&nbsp; He has seen that all along.&nbsp;
And at first it is a dreadful wrench to him.&nbsp; He feels how far
he is falling from his high ideals in life; and, at first, and for a
long time, it is a dreadful humiliation to him.&nbsp; But, then, there
are splendid compensations.&nbsp; And, better than that, there are some
good, and indeed compelling, reasons that begin to rise up in our minds
when we need them and begin to look for them, till what at first seemed
so mean and so contemptible, and so ungrateful, and so dishonourable,
as well as so spiritually perilous, comes to be faced and gone through
with positively on a ground of high principle, and, indeed, of stern
moral necessity.&nbsp; So deceitful is the human heart that you could
not believe what compelling reasons such a mean-spirited man will face
you with as to why he should leave all the ways he once so delighted
in for a piece of bread, and for the smile of the open enemies of his
church, and his faith, not to say his Saviour.&nbsp; You will meet with
several such men any afternoon coming home from their business.&nbsp;
Sometimes they have still some honest shame on their faces when they
meet you; but still oftener they pass you with a sullen hatred and a
fierce defiance.&nbsp; This is he who heard the word, and anon with
joy received it.&nbsp; Yet had he not root in himself, but dured for
a while; for when tribulation or persecution arose because of the word
by and by he was offended.&nbsp; They went out from us, says John, but
they were not of us; for if they had been of us they would no doubt
have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest
that they were not all of us.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Guilt, again, Hopeful went on, and to meditate terror, are
so grievous to most men, that they rather choose such ways as will but
harden their hearts still more and more.&nbsp; You all know what it
is to meditate terror?&nbsp; &ldquo;Thine heart shall meditate terror,&rdquo;
says the prophet, &ldquo;when thou sayest to thyself, who among us shall
dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting
burnings?&rdquo;&nbsp; The fifty-first Psalm is perhaps the best meditation
both of guilt and of terror that we have in the whole Bible.&nbsp; But
there are many other psalms and passages of psalms only second to the
fifty-first Psalm, such as the twenty-second, the thirty-eighth, the
sixty-ninth, and the hundred-and-thirtieth.&nbsp; Our Lord Himself also
was meditating terror in the garden of Gethsemane, and Paul both guilt
and terror when he imagined himself both an apostate preacher and a
castaway soul.&nbsp; And John&rsquo;s meditations of terror in the Revelation
rose into those magnificent pictures of the Last Judgment with which
he has to all time covered the walls of the Seven Churches.&nbsp; In
his own <i>Grace Abounding</i> there are meditations of terror quite
worthy to stand beside the most terrible things of that kind that ever
were written, as also in many others of our author&rsquo;s dramatical
and homiletical books.&nbsp; I read to you the other Sabbath morning
a meditation of terror that was found among Bishop Andrewes&rsquo; private
papers after his death.&nbsp; You will not all have forgotten that meditation,
but I will read it to you to-night again.&nbsp; &ldquo;How fearful,&rdquo;
says Andrewes, in his terror, &ldquo;will Thy judgment be, O Lord, when
the thrones are set, and the angels stand around, and men are brought
in, and the books are opened, and all our works are inquired into, and
all our thoughts are examined, and all the hidden things of darkness!&nbsp;
What, O God, shall Thy judgment that day be upon me?&nbsp; Who shall
quench my flame, who shall lighten my darkness, if Thou pity me not?&nbsp;
Lord, as Thou art loving, give me tears, give me floods of tears, and
give me all that this day, before it be too late.&nbsp; For then will
be the incorruptible Judge, the horrible judgment-seat, the answer without
excuse, the inevitable charge, the shameful punishment, the endless
Gehenna, the pitiless angels, the yawning hell, the roaring stream of
fire, the unquenchable flame, the dark prison, the rayless darkness,
the bed of live coals, the unwearied worm, the indissoluble chains,
the bottomless chaos, the impassable wall, the inconsolable cry.&nbsp;
And none to stand by me; none to plead for me; none to snatch me out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, no Temporary ever possessed anything like that in his own handwriting
among his private papers.&nbsp; A meditation like that, written out
with his own hand, and hidden away under lock and key, will secure any
man from it, even if he had been appointed to backsliding and reprobation.&nbsp;
Bishop Andrewes, as any one will see who reads his <i>Private Devotions</i>,
was the chief of sinners; but his discovered and deciphered papers will
all speak for him when they are spread out before the great white throne,
&ldquo;glorious in their deformity, being slubbered,&rdquo; as his editors
say, &ldquo;with his pious hands, and watered with his penitential tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Shepard&rsquo;s <i>Ten Virgins</i> is the most terrible book
upon Temporaries that ever was written.&nbsp; Temporaries never once
saw their true vileness, he keeps on saying.&nbsp; Temporaries are,
no doubt, wounded for sin sometimes, but never in the right place nor
to the right depth.&nbsp; And again, sin, and especially heart-sin,
is never really bitter to Temporaries.&nbsp; In an &ldquo;exhortation
to all new beginners, and so to all others,&rdquo; &ldquo;Be sure,&rdquo;
Shepard says, &ldquo;your wound for sin at first is deep enough.&nbsp;
For all the error in a man&rsquo;s faith and sanctification springs
from his first error in his humiliation.&nbsp; If a man&rsquo;s humiliation
be false, or even weak or little, then his faith and his hold of Christ
are weak and little, and his sanctification counterfeit.&nbsp; But if
a man&rsquo;s wound be right, and his humiliation deep enough, that
man&rsquo;s faith will be right and his sanctification will be glorious.&nbsp;
The esteem of Christ is always little where sin lies light.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Hopeful himself says a thing at this point that is quite worthy
of Shepard himself, such is its depth and insight.&nbsp; He speaks of
the righteous actually <i>loving</i> the sight of their misery.&nbsp;
He does not explain what he means by that startling language because
he is talking all the time, as he knows quite well, to one who understood
all that before he was born.&nbsp; Nor will I attempt to explain or
to vindicate what he says.&nbsp; Those of you who love the sight of
your own misery as sinners will understand what Hopeful says without
any explanation; while those who do not understand him would only be
the more stumbled by any explanation of him.&nbsp; The love of the sight
of their misery, and the unearthly sweetness of their sorrow for sin,
are only another two of those provoking paradoxes of which the lives
of God&rsquo;s true saints are full&mdash;paradoxes and impossibilities
and incoherencies that make the literature of experimental religion
to be positively hateful and unbearable to Temporary and to all his
self-seeking and apostate kindred.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But even where the consciences of such men are occasionally
awakened, proceeds Hopeful, in his so searching discovery of Temporaries,
yet their minds are not changed.&nbsp; There you are pretty near the
business, replied his fellow; for the bottom of all is, for want of
a change of their mind and will.&nbsp; Now, one would have been afraid
and ashamed for one moment to suspect that Temporary&rsquo;s mind was
not completely changed, so &ldquo;forward&rdquo; was he at first in
his religion.&nbsp; But, no: forward before all his neighbours as Temporary
was, to begin with, yet all the time his mind was not really changed.&nbsp;
His forwardness did not properly spring out of his true mind at all,
but only out of his momentarily awakened conscience and his momentarily
excited heart.&nbsp; A sinner with a truly changed mind is never forward.&nbsp;
His mind is so changed that forwardness in anything is utterly alien
to it, and especially all forwardness in the profession of religion.&nbsp;
The change that had taken place in Temporary, whatever was the seat
of it, only led him to bully men like Christian and Hopeful, who would
not go fast enough for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Pliable,
in the beginning of the book, &ldquo;come on and let us mend our pace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot go so fast as I would,&rdquo; humbly replied Christian,
&ldquo;because of this burden on my back.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a common
observation among mountaineers that he who takes the hill at the greatest
spurt is the last climber to come to the top, and that many who so ostentatiously
make spurts at the bottom of the hill never come within sight of the
top at all.&nbsp; And this is one of the constant dangers that wait
on all revivals, religious retreats, conferences, and even communion
seasons.&nbsp; Our hot fits, the hotter they are, are only the more
likely, unless we take the greatest care, to cast us down into all the
more deadly a chill.&nbsp; It is this danger that our Lord points out
so plainly in His parable of apostasy.&nbsp; The same is he, says our
Lord, that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath
he not root in himself, but dureth for a while.&nbsp; In Hopeful&rsquo;s
words, his mind and will were never changed with all his joy, only his
passing moods and his momentary emotions.</p>
<p>Multitudes of men who are as forward at first as Pliable and Temporary
were turn out at last to have no root in themselves; but here and there
you will discover a man who is all root together.&nbsp; There are some
men whose whole mind and heart and will, whose whole inward man, has
gone to root.&nbsp; All the strength and all the fatness of their religious
life retreat into its root.&nbsp; They have no leaves at all, and they
have too little fruit as yet; but you should see their roots.&nbsp;
Only, no eye but the eye of God can see sorrow for sin&mdash;secret
and sore humiliation on account of secret sin&mdash;the incessant agony
that goes on within between the flesh and the spirit, between sin and
grace, between very hell and heaven itself.&nbsp; To know your own evil
hearts, my brethren, say to you on that subject what any Temporary will,
is the very root of the whole matter to you.&nbsp; Whatever Dr. Newman&rsquo;s
mistakes as to outward churches may have been, he was a master of the
human heart, the most difficult of all matters to master.&nbsp; Listen,
then, to what he says on the matter now in hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, unless
we have some just idea of our hearts and of sin, we can have no right
idea of a Moral Governor, a Saviour, or a Sanctifier; that is, in professing
to believe in them we shall be using words without attaching any distinct
meaning to them.&nbsp; Thus self-knowledge is at the root of all real
religious knowledge; and it is vain,&mdash;it is worse than vain,&mdash;it
is a deceit and a mischief, to think to understand the Christian doctrines
as a matter of course, merely by being taught by books, or by attending
sermons, or by any outward means, however excellent, taken by themselves.&nbsp;
For it is in proportion as we search our hearts and understand our own
nature that we understand what is meant by an Infinite Governor and
Judge; it is in proportion as we comprehend the nature of disobedience
and our actual sinfulness that we feel what is the blessing of the removal
of sin, redemption, pardon, sanctification, which otherwise are mere
words.&nbsp; God speaks to us primarily in our hearts.&nbsp; Self-knowledge
is the key to the precepts and doctrines of Scripture.&nbsp; The very
utmost that any outward notices of religion can do is to startle us
and make us turn inward and search our hearts; and then, when we have
experienced what it is to read ourselves, we shall profit by the doctrine
of the Church and the Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; My brethren, the temper in
which you receive that passage, and receive it from its author, may
be safely taken by you as a sure presage whether you are to turn out
a Temporary and a Castaway or no.</p>
<p>Now, to conclude with a word of admission, and, bound up with it,
a word of encouragement.&nbsp; After all that has been said, I fully
admit that we are all Temporaries to begin with.&nbsp; We all cool down
from our first heat in religion.&nbsp; We all halt from our first spurt.&nbsp;
We all turn back from faith and from duty and from privilege through
our fear of men, or through our corrupt love of ourselves, or through
our coarse-minded love of this present world.&nbsp; Only, those who
are appointed to perseverance, and through that to eternal life, always
kindle again; they are kindled again, and they love the return of their
lost warmth.&nbsp; They recover themselves and address themselves again
and again to the race that is still set before them.&nbsp; They prove
themselves not to be of those who draw back unto perdition, but of those
that believe to the saving of the soul.&nbsp; Now, if you have only
too good ground to suspect that you are but a temporary believer, what
are you to do to make your sure escape out of that perilous state?&nbsp;
What, but to keep on believing?&nbsp; You must cry constantly, Lord,
I believe, help Thou mine unbelief!&nbsp; When at any time you are under
any temptation or corruption, and you feel that your faith and your
love are letting slip their hold of Christ and of eternal life, then
knot your weak heart all the faster to the throne of grace, to the cross
of Christ, and to the gate of heaven.&nbsp; Give up all your mind and
heart, and all that is within you, to the one thing needful.&nbsp; Labour
night and day in your own heart at believing on Christ, at loving your
neighbour, and at discovering, denying, and crucifying yourself.&nbsp;
It will all pay you in the long run.&nbsp; For if you do all these things,
and persistently do them, then, though you are at this moment all but
dead to all divine things, and all but a reprobate, it will be found
at last that all the time your name was written among the elect in heaven.</p>
<p>The perseverance of the saints, the &ldquo;five points&rdquo; notwithstanding,
is not a foregone conclusion.&nbsp; The final perseverance of the ripest
and surest saint is all made up of ever-new beginnings in repentance,
in faith, in love, and in obedience.&nbsp; Begin, then, every new day
to repent anew, to return anew, to believe and to love anew.&nbsp; And
if all your New-Year repentances and returnings and reformations are
all already proved to be but temporary&mdash;even if they lie all around
you already a bitter mockery of all your professions&mdash;still, begin
again.&nbsp; Begin to-night, and begin again to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
Spend all the remainder of your days on earth beginning.&nbsp; And,
ere ever you are aware, the final perseverance of another predestinated
saint will be found accomplished in you.</p>
<h2>SECRET</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A truly religious life is always a secret life: it is a life hid,
as Paul has it, with Christ in God.&nbsp; The secret of the Lord, says
the Psalmist, is with them that fear Him.&nbsp; And thus it is that
when men begin to fear God, both their hearts and their lives are henceforth
full of all kinds of secrets that are known to themselves and to God
only.&nbsp; It was when Christiana&rsquo;s fearful thoughts began to
work in her mind about her husband whom she had lost&mdash;it was when
all her unkind, unnatural, and ungodly carriages to her dear friend
came into her mind in swarms, clogged her conscience, and loaded her
with guilt&mdash;it was then that Secret knocked at her door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Next morning,&rdquo; so her opening history runs, &ldquo;when
she was up, and had prayed to God, and talked with her children awhile,
one knocked hard at the door to whom she spake out, saying, If thou
comest in God&rsquo;s name, come in.&nbsp; So he who was at the door
said, Amen, and opened the door, and saluted her with, Peace be to this
house.&nbsp; The which when he had done, he said, Christiana, knowest
thou wherefore I am come?&nbsp; Then she blushed and trembled, also
her heart began to wax warm with desires to know whence he came, and
what was his errand to her.&nbsp; So he said unto her, My name is Secret,
I dwell with those that are high.&nbsp; It is talked of where I dwell
as if thou hadst a desire to go thither; also, there is a report that
thou art aware now of the evil thou formerly didst to thy husband in
hardening of thy heart against his way, and in keeping of thy babes
in their ignorance.&nbsp; Christiana, the Merciful One has sent me to
tell thee that He is a God ready to forgive, and that He taketh delight
to multiply to pardon offences.&nbsp; He would also have thee know that
He inviteth thee to come into His presence, even to His table, and that
He will there feed thee with the fat of His house, and with the heritage
of Jacob thy father.&nbsp; Christiana at all this was greatly abashed
in herself, and she bowed her head to the ground, while her visitor
proceeded and said, Christiana, here is a letter for thee which I have
brought from thy husband&rsquo;s King.&nbsp; So she took it and opened
it, and, as she opened it, it smelt after the manner of the best perfume;
also it was written in lettering of gold.&nbsp; The contents of the
letter was to this effect, that the King would have her do as did Christian
her husband, for that was the way to come to the city and to dwell in
His presence with joy for ever.&nbsp; At this the good woman was completely
overcome.&nbsp; So she said to her visitor, Sir, will you carry me and
my children with you that we may go and worship this King?&nbsp; Then
said the heavenly visitor, Christiana, the bitter is before the sweet.&nbsp;
Thou must through troubles, as did he that went before thee, enter this
celestial city.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, to begin with, you will have noticed the way in which
Christiana was prepared for the entrance of Secret into her house.&nbsp;
She was a widow.&nbsp; She sat alone in that loneliness which only widows
know and understand.&nbsp; More than lonely, she was very miserable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mark this,&rdquo; says the author on the margin, &ldquo;you that
are churls to your godly relations.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this widow felt
sure that her husband had been taken from her because of her cruel behaviour
to him.&nbsp; Her past unnatural carriages toward her husband now rent
the very caul of her heart in sunder.&nbsp; And, again and again, about
that same time strange dreams would sometimes visit her.&nbsp; Dreams
such as this.&nbsp; She would see her husband in a place of bliss with
a harp in his hand, standing and playing upon it before One that sat
on a throne with a rainbow round His head.&nbsp; She saw also as if
he bowed his head with his face to the paved work that was under the
Prince&rsquo;s feet, saying, I heartily thank my Lord and King for bringing
me to this place.&nbsp; You will easily see how ready this lone woman
was with all that for his entrance who knocked and said, Peace be to
this house, and handed her a letter of perfume from her husband&rsquo;s
King.&nbsp; Then you will have remarked also some of the things this
visitor from on high said to her of the place whence he had come.&nbsp;
He told her, to begin with, how they sometimes talked about her in his
country.&nbsp; She thought that she was a lonely and forgotten widow,
and that no one cared what became of her.&nbsp; But her visitor assured
her she was quite wrong in thinking that.&nbsp; He had often himself
heard her name mentioned in conversation above; and the most hopeful
reports, he told her, were circulated from door to door that she was
actually all but started on the upward way.&nbsp; Yes, he said, and
we have a place prepared for you on the strength of these reports, a
place among the immortals close beside your husband.&nbsp; And all that,
as you will not wonder, was the beginning of Christiana&rsquo;s secret
life.&nbsp; After that morning she never again felt alone or forgotten.&nbsp;
I am not alone, she would after that say, when any of her old neighbours
knocked at her door.&nbsp; No, I am not alone, but if thou comest in
God&rsquo;s name, come in.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And from that day a long succession of secret providences
began to enter Christiana&rsquo;s life, till, as time went on, her whole
life was filled full of secret providences.&nbsp; And not her present
life only, but her discoveries of God&rsquo;s secret providences towards
her and hers became retrospective also, till both her own parentage
and birth, her husband&rsquo;s parentage and birth also, the day she
first saw him, the day of their espousals, the day of their marriage,
and the day of his death, all shone out now as so many secret and special
providences of God toward her.&nbsp; Bishop Martensen has a fine passage
on the fragmentariness of our knowledge, not only of divine providence
as a whole, but even of those divine providences that fill up our own
lives.&nbsp; And he warns us that, till we have heard the &ldquo;Prologue
in Heaven,&rdquo; many a riddle in our lives must of necessity remain
unsolved.&nbsp; Christiana could not have told her inquiring children
what a prologue was, nor an epilogue either, but many were the wise
and winning discourses she held with her boys about their father now
in heaven, about her happiness in having had such a father for her children,
and about their happiness that the road was open before them to go to
where he now is.&nbsp; And there are many poor widows among ourselves
who are wiser than all their teachers, because they are in that school
of experience into which God takes His afflicted people and opens to
them His deepest secrets.&nbsp; They remember, with Job, when the secret
of the Lord was first upon their tabernacle.&nbsp; Their widowed hearts
are full of holy household memories.&nbsp; They remember the days when
the candle of the Lord shone upon their head when they washed their
steps with butter, and the rock poured them out rivers of oil.&nbsp;
And still, when, like Job also, they sit solitary among the ashes, the
secret of the Lord is only the more secretly and intimately with them.&nbsp;
John Bunyan was well fitted to be Christiana&rsquo;s biographer, because
his own life was as full as it could hold of these same secret and special
providences.&nbsp; One day he was walking&mdash;so he tells us&mdash;in
a good man&rsquo;s shop, bemoaning himself of his sad and doleful state&mdash;when
a mighty rushing wind came in through the window and seemed to carry
words of Scripture on its wings to Bunyan&rsquo;s disconsolate soul.&nbsp;
He candidly tells us that he does not know, after twenty years&rsquo;
reflection, what to make of that strange dispensation.&nbsp; That it
took place, and that it left the most blessed results behind it, he
is sure; but as to how God did it, by what means, by what instruments,
both the rushing wind itself and the salutation that accompanied it,
he is fain to let lie till the day of judgment.&nbsp; And many of ourselves
have had strange dispensations too that we must leave alone, and seek
no other explanation of them for the present but the blessed results
of them.&nbsp; We have had divine descents into our lives that we can
never attempt to describe.&nbsp; Interpositions as plain to us as if
we had both seen and spoken with the angel who executed them.&nbsp;
Miraculous deliverances that throw many Old and New Testament miracles
into the shade.&nbsp; Providential adaptations and readjustments also,
as if all things were actually and openly and without a veil being made
to work together for our good.&nbsp; Extrications also; nets broken,
snares snapped, and such pavilions of safety and solace opened to us
that we can find no psalm secret and special enough in which to utter
our life-long astonishment.&nbsp; Importunate prayers anticipated, postponed,
denied, translated, transmuted, and then answered till our cup was too
full; sweet changed to bitter, and bitter changed to sweet, so wonderfully,
so graciously, and so often, that words fail us, and we can only now
laugh and now weep over it all.&nbsp; Poor Cowper knew something about
it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God moves in a mysterious way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonders to perform;<br />
He plants His footsteps in the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rides upon the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds ye so much dread<br />
Are big with mercy, and shall break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessings on your head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind unbelief is sure to err,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scan his work in vain;<br />
God is His own interpreter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And He will make it plain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; Secret scriptures also&mdash;from that enlightening day
Christiana&rsquo;s Bible became full of them.&nbsp; Peter says that
no prophecy is of any private interpretation; and, whatever he means
by that, what he says must be true.&nbsp; But Christiana would have
understood the apostle better if he had said the exact opposite of that,&mdash;if
not about the prophecies, at least about the psalms.&nbsp; Leave the
prophecies in this connection alone; but of the psalms it may safely
be said that it is neither the literal nor the historical nor the mystical
interpretation that gets at the heart of those supreme scriptures.&nbsp;
It is the private, personal, and, indeed, secret interpretation that
gets best at the deepest heart of the psalms.&nbsp; An old Bible came
into my hands the other day&mdash;a Bible that had seen service&mdash;and
it opened of its own accord at the Book of Psalms.&nbsp; On turning
over the yellow leaves I found a date and a deep indentation opposite
these words: &ldquo;Commit thy way unto the Lord: trust also in Him:
and He will bring it to pass.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as I looked at the figures
on the margin, and at the underscored text, I felt as if I were on the
brink of an old-world secret.&nbsp; &ldquo;Create in me a clean heart&rdquo;
had a significant initial also; as had this: &ldquo;The sacrifices of
God are a broken spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole of the hundred-and-third
psalm was bracketed off from all public interpretation; while the tenth,
the cardinal verse of that secret psalm, had a special seal set upon
it.&nbsp; Judging from its stains and scars and other accidents, the
whole of the hundred-and-nineteenth psalm had been a special favourite;
while the hundred-and-forty-third also was all broidered round with
shorthand symbols.&nbsp; But the secret key of all those symbols and
dates and enigmatical marks was no longer to be found; it had been carried
away in the owner&rsquo;s own heart.&nbsp; But, my head being full of
Christiana at the time, I felt as if I held her own old Bible in my
hand as I turned over those ancient leaves.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Our Lord so practised secrecy Himself in His fasting, in
His praying, and in His almsgiving, and He makes so much of that same
secrecy in all His teaching, as almost to make the essence of all true
religion to stand in its secrecy.&nbsp; &ldquo;When thou prayest,&rdquo;
says our Lord, &ldquo;shut thy door and pray in secret.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As much as to say that we are scarcely praying at all when we are praying
in public.&nbsp; Praying in public is so difficult that new beginners,
like His disciples, have to practise that so difficult art for a long
time in secret.&nbsp; Public prayer has so many besetting sins, it is
open to so many temptations, distractions, and corruptions, that it
is almost impossible to preserve the real essence of prayer in public
prayer.&nbsp; But in secret all those temptations and distractions are
happily absent.&nbsp; We have no temptation to be too long in secret
prayer, or too loud, or too eloquent.&nbsp; Stately old English goes
for nothing in secret prayer.&nbsp; We never need to go to our knees
in secret trembling, lest we lose the thread of our prayer, or forget
that so fit and so fine expression.&nbsp; The longer we are the better
in secret prayer.&nbsp; Much speaking is really a virtue in secret prayer;
much speaking and many repetitions.&nbsp; Also, we can put things into
our secret prayers that we dare not come within a thousand miles of
in the pulpit, or the prayer-meeting, or the family.&nbsp; We can enter
into the most plain-spoken particulars about ourselves in secret.&nbsp;
We can put our proper name upon ourselves, and upon our actions, and
especially upon our thoughts when our door is shut.&nbsp; Then, again,
we can pray for other people by name in secret; we can enter, so far
as we know them, into all their circumstances in a way it is impossible
to do anywhere but in the utmost secrecy.&nbsp; We can, in short, be
ourselves in secret; and, unless it is to please or to impress men,
we had better not pray at all unless we are ourselves when we are engaged
in it.&nbsp; You can be yourself, your very worst self; nay, you must
be, else you will not long pray in secret, and even if you did you would
not be heard.&nbsp; I do not remember that very much is said in so many
words in her after-history about Christiana&rsquo;s habits of closet-prayer.&nbsp;
But that Secret taught her the way, and waited till she had tasted the
sweetness and the strength of being a good while on her knees alone,
I am safe to say; indeed, I read it between the lines in all her after-life.&nbsp;
She was rewarded openly in a way that testifies to much secret prayer;
that is to say, in the early conversion of her children, in the way
they settled in life, and such like things.&nbsp; Pray much for those
things in secret that you wish to possess openly.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But perhaps the best and most infallible evidence we can
have of the truth of our religion in this life is in the steady increase
of our secret sinfulness.&nbsp; Christiana had no trouble with her own
wicked heart so long as she was a woman of a wicked life.&nbsp; But
directly she became a new creature, her heart began to swarm, such is
her own expression, with sinful memories, sinful thoughts, and sinful
feelings; till she had need of some one ever near her, like Greatheart,
constantly to assure her that those cruel and deadly swarms, instead
of being a bad sign of her salvation, were the very best signs possible
of her good estate.&nbsp; Humility is the foundation of all our graces,
and there is no humility so deep and so ever-deepening as that evangelical
humility which in its turn rises out of and rests upon secret sinfulness.&nbsp;
Not upon acts of secret sin.&nbsp; Do not mistake me.&nbsp; Acts of
secret sin harden the heart and debauch the conscience.&nbsp; But I
speak of that secret, original, unexplored, and inexpugnable sinfulness
out of which all a sinner&rsquo;s actual sins, both open sins and secret,
spring; and out of which a like life of open and actual sins would spring
in God&rsquo;s very best saints, if only both He and they did not watch
night and day against them.&nbsp; Sensibility to sin, or rather to sinfulness,
is far and away the best evidence of sanctification that is possible
to us in this life.&nbsp; It is this keen and bitter sensibility that
secures, amid all oppositions and obstructions, the true saint&rsquo;s
onward and upward progress.&nbsp; Were it not for the misery of their
own hearts, God&rsquo;s best saints would fall asleep and go back like
other men.&nbsp; A sinful heart is the misery of all miseries.&nbsp;
It is the deepest and darkest of all dungeons.&nbsp; It is the most
painful and the most loathsome of all diseases.&nbsp; And the secrecy
of it all adds to the bitterness and the gall of it all.&nbsp; We may
know that other men&rsquo;s hearts are as sinful as our own, but we
do not feel their sinfulness.&nbsp; We cannot sensibly feel humiliation,
bondage, sickness, and self-loathing on account of another man&rsquo;s
envy, or ill-will, or resentment, or cruelty, or falsehood, or impurity.&nbsp;
All these things must be our own before we can enter into the pain and
the shame of them; but, when we do, then we taste what death and hell
are indeed.&nbsp; As I write these feeble words about it, a devil&rsquo;s
shaft of envy that was shot all against my will into my heart this morning,
still, after a whole day, rankles and festers there.&nbsp; I have been
on my knees with it again and again; I have stood and looked into an
open grave to-day; but there it is sucking at my heart&rsquo;s blood
still, like a leech of hell.&nbsp; Who can understand his errors?&nbsp;
Cleanse Thou me from secret faults.&nbsp; Create in me a clean heart,
O God, O wretched man that I am!&nbsp; &ldquo;Let a man,&rdquo; says
William Law when he is enforcing humility, &ldquo;but consider that
if the world knew all that of him which he knows of himself: if they
saw what vanity and what passions govern his inside, and what secret
tempers sully and corrupt his best actions, he would have no more pretence
to be honoured and admired for his goodness and wisdom than a rotten
and distempered body to be loved and admired for its beauty and comeliness.&nbsp;
This is so true, and so known to the hearts of almost all people, that
nothing would appear more dreadful to them than to have their hearts
fully discovered to the eyes of all beholders.&nbsp; And, perhaps, there
are very few people in the world who would not rather choose to die
than to have all their secret follies, the errors of their judgments,
the vanity of their minds, the falseness of their pretences, the frequency
of their vain and disorderly passions, their uneasinesses, hatreds,
envies, and vexations made known to all the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where
did William Law get that terrible passage?&nbsp; Where could he get
it but in the secret heart of the miserable author of the <i>Serious
Call</i>?</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The half cannot be told of the guilt and the corruption,
the pain and the shame and the manifold misery of secret sin; but all
that will be told, believed, and understood by all men long before the
full magnificence of their sanctification, and the superb transcendence
of their blessedness, will even begin to be described to God&rsquo;s
secret saints.&nbsp; For, all that sleepless, cruel, and soul-killing
pain, and all that shameful and humbling corruption,&mdash;all that
means, all that is, so much holiness, so much heaven, working itself
out in the soul.&nbsp; All that is so much immortal life, spotless beauty,
and incorruptible joy already begun in the soul.&nbsp; Every such pang
in a holy heart is a death-pang of another sin and a birth-pang of another
grace.&nbsp; Brotherly love is at last being born never to die in that
heart where envy and malice and resentment and revenge are causing inward
agony.&nbsp; And humility and meekness and the whole mind of Christ
are there where pride and anger and ill-will are felt to be very hell
itself.&nbsp; And holiness, even as God is holy, will soon be there
for ever where the sinfulness of sin is a sinner&rsquo;s acutest sorrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said one whose sin was ever before him, &ldquo;I
will behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I wake
with Thy likeness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MRS. TIMOROUS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the fearful [literally, the timid and the
cowardly] shall have their part in the second death.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Revelation
xxi</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sooner had Secret bidden Christiana farewell than she began with
all her might to make ready for her great journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
my children, let us pack up and begone to the gate that leads to the
Celestial City, that we may see your father and be with him, and with
his companions, in peace, according to the laws of that land.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then: &ldquo;Come in, if you come in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; Christiana
called out, as two of her neighbours knocked at her door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having
little to do at home this morning,&rdquo; said the elder of the two
women, &ldquo;I have come across to kill a little time with you.&nbsp;
I spent last night with Mrs. Light-mind, and I have some good news for
you this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am just preparing for a journey
this morning,&rdquo; said Christiana, packing up all the time, &ldquo;and
I have not so much as one moment to spare.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know yourselves
what Christiana&rsquo;s nervousness and almost impatience were.&nbsp;
You know how it upsets your good temper and all your civility when you
are packing up for a long absence from home, and some one comes in,
and will talk, and will not see how behindhand and how busy you are.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For what journey, I pray you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Timorous, for
that was her visitor&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even to go after my
good husband,&rdquo; the busy woman said, and with that she fell a-weeping.&nbsp;
But you must read the whole account of that eventful morning in Christiana&rsquo;s
memoirs for yourselves till you have it, as Secret said, by root-of-heart.&nbsp;
On the understanding that you are not total strangers to that so excellently-written
passage I shall now venture a few observations upon it.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, to begin with, Mrs. Timorous was not a bad woman,
as women went in that town and in that day.&nbsp; Her companions,&mdash;her
gossips, as she would have called them,&mdash;were far worse women than
she was; and, had it not been for her family infirmity, had it not been
for that timid, hesitating, lukewarm, and half-and-half habit of mind
which she had inherited from her father, there is no saying what part
she might have played in the famous expedition of Christiana and Mercy
and the boys.&nbsp; Her father had been a pilgrim himself at one time;
but he had now for a long time been known in the town as a turncoat
and a temporary, and all his children had unhappily taken after their
father in that.&nbsp; Had her father held on as he at one time had begun&mdash;had
he held on in the face of all fear and all danger as Christiana&rsquo;s
noble husband had done&mdash;to a certainty his daughter would have
started that morning with Christiana and her company, and would have
been, if a timid, easily scared, and troublesome pilgrim, yet as true
a pilgrim, and made as welcome at last, as, say, Miss Much-afraid, Mr.
Fearing, and Mr. Ready-to-halt were made.&nbsp; But her father&rsquo;s
superficiality and shakiness, and at bottom his warm love of this world
and his lukewarm love of the world to come, had unfortunately all descended
to his daughter, till we find her actually reviling Christiana on that
decisive morning, and returning to her dish of tea and tittle-tattle
with Mrs. Bats-eyes, Mrs. Inconsiderate, Mrs. Light-mind, and Mrs. Know-nothing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The thing that positively terrified Mrs. Timorous at the
very thought of setting out with Christiana that morning was that intolerable
way in which Christiana had begun to go back upon her past life as a
wife and a mother.&nbsp; Christiana could not hide her deep distress,
and, indeed, she did not much try.&nbsp; Such were the swarms of painful
memories that her husband&rsquo;s late death, the visit of Secret, and
one thing and another had let loose upon Christiana&rsquo;s mind, that
she could take pleasure in nothing but in how she was to escape away
from her past life, and how she could in any way mend it and make up
for it where she could not escape from it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may judge
yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Timorous to Mrs. Light-mind, &ldquo;whether
I was likely to find much entertainment with a woman like that!&rdquo;&nbsp;
For, Mrs. Timorous too, you must know, had a past life of her own; and
it was that past life of hers all brought back by Christiana&rsquo;s
words that morning that made Mrs. Timorous so revile her old friend
and return to the society we so soon see her with.&nbsp; Now, is not
this the case, that we all have swarms of evil memories that we dare
not face?&nbsp; There is no single relationship in life that we can
boldly look back upon and fully face.&nbsp; As son or as daughter, as
brother or as sister, as friend or as lover, as husband or as wife,
as minister or as member, as master or as servant&mdash;what swarms
of hornet-memories darken our hearts as we so look back!&nbsp; Let any
grown-up man, with some imagination, tenderness of heart, and integrity
of conscience, go back step by step, taking some time to it,&mdash;at
a new year, say, or a birthday, or on some such suitable occasion: let
him go over his past life back to his youth and childhood&mdash;and
what an intolerable burden will be laid on his heart before he is done!&nbsp;
What a panorama of scarlet pictures will pass before his inward eye!&nbsp;
What a forest of accusing fingers will be pointed at him!&nbsp; What
hissing curses will be spat at him both by the lips of the living and
the dead!&nbsp; What untold pains he will see that he has caused to
the innocent and the helpless!&nbsp; What desolating disappointments,
what shipwrecks of hope to this man and to that woman!&nbsp; What a
stone of stumbling he has been to many who on that stone have been for
ever broken and lost!&nbsp; What a rock of offence even his mere innocent
existence, all unknown to himself till afterwards, has been!&nbsp; Swarms,
said Christiana.&nbsp; Swarms of hornets armed, said Samson.&nbsp; And
many of us understand what that bitter word means better than any commentator
on Bunyan or on Milton can tell us.&nbsp; One of the holiest men the
Church of England ever produced, and one of her best devotional writers,
used to shut his door on the night of every first day of the week, and
on his knees spread out a prayer which always contained this passage:
&ldquo;I worship Thee, O God, on my face.&nbsp; I smite my breast and
say with the publican, God be merciful to me a sinner; the chief of
sinners; a sinner far above the publican.&nbsp; Despise me not&mdash;an
unclean worm, a dead dog, a putrid corpse.&nbsp; Despise me not, despise
me not, O Lord.&nbsp; But look upon me with those eyes with which Thou
didst look upon Magdalene at the feast, Peter in the hall, and the thief
on the cross.&nbsp; O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears that I
might weep night and day before Thee!&nbsp; I despise and bruise myself
that my penitence is not deeper, is not fuller.&nbsp; Help Thou mine
impenitence, and more and more pierce, rend, and crush my heart.&nbsp;
My sins are more in number than the sand.&nbsp; My iniquities are multiplied,
and I have no relief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perish your Puritanism, and your
prayer-books too!&nbsp; I hear some high-minded and indignant man saying.&nbsp;
Perish your Celestial City and all my desire after it, before I say
the like of that about myself!&nbsp; Brave words, my brother; brave
words!&nbsp; But there have been men as blameless as you are, and as
brave-hearted over it, who, when the scales fell off their eyes, were
heard crying out ever after: O wretched man that I am!&nbsp; And: Have
mercy on me, the chief of sinners!&nbsp; And so, if it so please God,
will it yet be with you.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having had little to do this morning,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Timorous to Mrs. Light-mind, &ldquo;I went to give Christiana a
visit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Law,&rdquo; I read in his most impressive
Life, &ldquo;by this time was well turned fifty, but he rose as early
and was as soon at his desk as when he was still a new, enthusiastic,
and scrupulously methodical student at Cambridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Summer
and winter Law rose to his devotions and his studies at five o&rsquo;clock,
not because he had imperative sermons to prepare, but because, in his
own words, it is more reasonable to suppose a person up early because
he is a Christian than because he is a labourer or a tradesman or a
servant.&nbsp; I have a great deal of business to do, he would say.&nbsp;
I have a hardened heart to change; I have still the whole spirit of
religion to get.&nbsp; When Law at any time felt a temptation to relax
his rule of early devotion, he again reminded himself how fast he was
becoming an old man, and how far back his sanctification still was,
till he flung himself out of bed and began to make himself a new heart
before the servants had lighted their fires or the farmers had yoked
their horses.&nbsp; Shame on you, he said to himself, to lie folded
up in a bed when you might be pouring out your heart in prayer and in
praise, and thus be preparing yourself for a place among those blessed
beings who rest not day and night saying, Holy, Holy, Holy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have little to do this morning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Timorous.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I am preparing for a journey,&rdquo; said Christiana.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have now a price put into my hand to get gain, and I should be a fool
of the greatest size if I should have no heart to strike in with the
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Another thing that completely threw out Christiana&rsquo;s
idle visitor and made her downright angry was the way she would finger
and kiss and read pieces out of the fragrant letter she held in her
hand.&nbsp; You will remember how Christiana came by that letter she
was now so fond of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Secret, &ldquo;is
a letter I have brought thee from thy husband&rsquo;s King.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So she took it and opened it, and it smelt after the manner of the best
perfume; also it was written in letters of gold.&nbsp; &ldquo;I advise
thee,&rdquo; said Secret, &ldquo;that thou put this letter in thy bosom,
that thou read therein to thy children until you have all got it by
root-of-heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His messenger was here,&rdquo; said
Christiana to Mrs. Timorous, &ldquo;and has brought me a letter which
invites me to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that she plucked out the letter
and read to her out of it, and said: &ldquo;What now do you say to all
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; That, again, is so true to our own life.&nbsp; For
there is nothing that more distastes and disrelishes many people among
us than just that we should name to them our favourite books, and read
a passage out of them, and ask them to say what they think of such wonderful
words.&nbsp; Samuel Rutherford&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>, for instance;
a book that smells to some nostrils with the same heavenly perfume as
Secret&rsquo;s own letter did.&nbsp; A book, moreover, that is written
in the same ink of gold.&nbsp; Ask at afternoon tea to-morrow, even
in so-called Christian homes, when any of the ladies round the table
last read, and how often they have read, <i>Grace Abounding, The Saint&rsquo;s
Rest, The Religious Affections, Jeremy Taylor, Law, &agrave; Kempis,
F&eacute;nelon</i>, or such like, and they will smile to one another
and remark after you are gone on your strange taste for old-fashioned
and long-winded and introspective books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Julia has buried
her husband and married her daughters, and since that she spends her
time in reading.&nbsp; She is always reading foolish and unedifying
books.&nbsp; She tells you every time she sees you that she is almost
at the end of the silliest book that ever she read in her life.&nbsp;
But the best of it is that it serves to dispose of a good deal of her
spare time.&nbsp; She tells you all romances are sad stuff, yet she
is very impatient till she can get all she can hear of.&nbsp; Histories
of intrigue and scandal are the books that Julia thinks are always too
short.&nbsp; The truth is, she lives upon folly and scandal and impertinence.&nbsp;
These things are the support of her dull hours.&nbsp; And yet she does
not see that in all this she is plainly telling you that she is in a
miserable, disordered, reprobate state of mind.&nbsp; Now, whether you
read her books or no, you perhaps think with her that it is a dull task
to read only religious and especially spiritual books.&nbsp; But when
you have the spirit of true religion, when you can think of God as your
only happiness, when you are not afraid of the joys of eternity, you
will think it a dull task to read any other books.&nbsp; When it is
the care of your soul to be humble, holy, pure, and heavenly-minded;
when you know anything of the guilt and misery of sin, or feel a real
need of salvation, then you will find religious and truly spiritual
books to be the greatest feast and joy of your mind and heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; And then we shall thank God every day we live that He raised
us up such helpers in our salvation as the gifted and gracious authors
we have been speaking of.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &ldquo;The further I go the more danger I meet with,&rdquo;
said old Timorous, the father, to Christian, when Christian asked him
on the Hill Difficulty why he was running the wrong way.&nbsp; &ldquo;I,
too, was going to the City of Zion,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the further
on I go the more danger I meet with.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, in saying that,
the old runaway gave our persevering pilgrim something to think about
for all his days.&nbsp; For, again and again, and times without number,
Christian would have gone back too if only he had known where to go.&nbsp;
Go on, therefore, he must.&nbsp; To go back to him was simply impossible.&nbsp;
Every day he lived he felt the bitter truth of what that old apostate
had so unwittingly said.&nbsp; But, with all that he kept himself in
his onward way till, dangers and difficulties, death and hell and all,
he came to the blessed end of it.&nbsp; And that same has been the universal
experience of all the true and out-and-out saints of God in all time.&nbsp;
If poor old Timorous had only known it, if he had only had some one
beside him to remind him of it, the very thing that so fatally turned
him back was the best proof possible that he was on the right and the
only right way; ay, and fast coming, poor old castaway, to the very
city he had at one time set out to seek.&nbsp; Now, it is only too likely
that there are some of my hearers at this with it to-night, that they
are on the point of giving up the life of faith, and hope, and love,
and holy living; because the deeper they carry that life into their
own hearts the more impossible they find it to live that life there.&nbsp;
The more they aim their hearts at God&rsquo;s law the more they despair
of ever coming within sight of it.&nbsp; My supremely miserable brother!
if this is any consolation to you, if you can take any crumb of consolation
out of it, let this be told you, that, as a matter of fact, all truly
holy men have in their heart of hearts had your very experience.&nbsp;
That is no strange and unheard-of thing which is passing within you.&nbsp;
And, indeed, if you could but believe it, that is one of the surest
signs and seals of a true and genuine child of God.&nbsp; Dante, one
of the bravest, but hardest bestead of God&rsquo;s saints, was, just
like you, well-nigh giving up the mountain altogether when his Greatheart,
who was always at his side, divining what was going on within him, said
to him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those scars<br />
That when they pain thee most then kindliest heal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The more I do,&rdquo; complained one of Thomas Shepard&rsquo;s
best friends to him, &ldquo;the worse I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
best saints are the most sensible of sin,&rdquo; wrote Samuel Rutherford.&nbsp;
And, again he wrote, &ldquo;Sin rages far more in the godly than ever
it does in the ungodly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And you dare not deny but that
Samuel Rutherford was one of the holiest men that ever lived, or that
in saying all that he was speaking of himself.&nbsp; And Newman: &ldquo;Every
one who tries to do God&rsquo;s will&rdquo;&mdash;and that also is Newman
himself&mdash;&ldquo;will feel himself to be full of all imperfection
and sin; and the more he succeeds in regulating his heart, the more
will he discern its original bitterness and guilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; As our
own hymn has it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They who fain would serve Thee best<br />
Are conscious most of wrong within.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without knowing it, Mrs. Timorous&rsquo;s runaway father was speaking
the same language as the chief of the saints.&nbsp; Only he said, &ldquo;Therefore
I have turned back,&rdquo; whereas, first Christian, and then Christiana
his widow, said, &ldquo;Yet I must venture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so say you.&nbsp; Say, I must and I will venture!&nbsp; Say it;
clench your teeth and your hands and say it.&nbsp; Say that you are
determined to go on towards heaven where the holy are&mdash;absolutely
determined, though you are quite well aware that you are carrying up
with you the blackest, the wickedest, the most corrupt, and the most
abominable heart either out of hell or in it.&nbsp; Say that, say all
that, and still venture.&nbsp; Say all that and all the more venture.&nbsp;
Venture upon God of whom such reassuring things are said.&nbsp; Venture
upon the Son of God of whom His Father is represented as saying such
inviting things.&nbsp; Venture upon the cross.&nbsp; Survey the wondrous
cross and then make a bold venture upon it.&nbsp; Think who that is
who is bleeding to death upon the cross, and why?&nbsp; Look at Him
till you never afterwards can see anything else.&nbsp; Look at God&rsquo;s
Eternal, Divine, Well-pleasing Son with all the wages of sin dealt out
to Him, body and soul, on that tree to the uttermost farthing.&nbsp;
And, devil incarnate though you indeed are, yet, say, if that spectacle
does not satisfy you, and encourage you, and carry your cowardice captive.&nbsp;
Venture! I say, venture!&nbsp; And if you find at last that you have
ventured too far&mdash;if you have sinned and corrupted yourself beyond
redemption&mdash;then it will be some consolation and distinction to
you in hell that you had out-sinned the infinite grace of God, and had
seen the end of the unsearchable riches of Christ.&nbsp; Timid sinner,
I but mock thee, therefore venture!&nbsp; Fearful sinner, venture!&nbsp;
Cowardly sinner, venture.&nbsp; Venture thyself upon thy God, upon Christ
thy Saviour, and upon His cross.&nbsp; Venture all thy guilt and all
thy corruption taken together upon Christ hanging upon His cross, and
make that tremendous venture now!</p>
<h2>MERCY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain
mercy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time that we see Mercy she is standing one sunshine morning
knocking along with another at Christiana&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; And all
that we afterwards hear of Mercy might be described as, A morning call
and all that came of it; or, How a godly matron led on a poor maid to
fall in love with her own salvation.&nbsp; John Bunyan, her biographer,
in all his devotion to Mercy, does not make it at all clear to us why
such a sweet and good girl as Mercy was could be on such intimate terms
with Mrs. Timorous and all her so questionable circle.&nbsp; Could it
be that Mercy&rsquo;s mother was one of that unhappy set?&nbsp; And
had this dear little woman-child been brought up so as to know no better
than to figure in their assemblies, and go out on their morning rounds
with Mrs. Light-mind and Mrs. Know-nothing?&nbsp; Or, was poor Mercy
an orphan with no one to watch over her, and had her sweet face, her
handsome figure, and her winning manners made her one of the attractions
of old Madam Wanton&rsquo;s midnight routs?&nbsp; However it came about,
there was Mercy out on a series of morning calls with a woman twice
her age, but a woman whose many years had taught her neither womanliness
nor wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you come in God&rsquo;s name, come in,&rdquo;
a voice from the inside answered the knocking of Mrs. Timorous and Mercy,
her companion, at Christiana&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; In all their rounds
that morning the two women had not been met with another salutation
like that; and that strange salutation so disconcerted and so confounded
them that they did not know whether to lift the latch and go in, or
to run away and leave those to go in who could take their delight in
such outlandish language.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you come in God&rsquo;s name,
come in.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this the women were stunned, for this kind
of language they used not to hear or to perceive to drop from the lips
of Christiana.&nbsp; Yet they came in; but, behold, they found the good
woman preparing to be gone from her house.&nbsp; The conversation that
ensued was all carried on by the two elder women.&nbsp; For it was often
remarked about Mercy all her after-days that her voice was ever soft,
and low, and, especially, seldom heard.&nbsp; But her ears were not
idle.&nbsp; For all the time the debate went on&mdash;because by this
time the conversation had risen to be a debate&mdash;Mercy was taking
silent sides with Christiana and her distress and her intended enterprise,
till, when Mrs. Timorous reviled Christiana and said, &ldquo;Come away,
Mercy, and leave her in her own hands,&rdquo; Mercy by that time was
brought to a standstill.&nbsp; For, like a rose among thorns, Mercy
was thoughtful and wise and womanly far beyond her years.&nbsp; So much
so, that already she had made up her mind to offer herself as a maidservant
to help the widow with her work and to see her so far on her way, and,
indeed, though she kept that to herself, to go all the way with her,
if the way should prove open to her.&nbsp; First, her heart yearned
over Christiana; so she said within herself, If my neighbour will needs
be gone, I will go a little way with her to help her.&nbsp; Secondly,
her heart yearned over her own soul&rsquo;s salvation, for what Christiana
had said had taken some hold upon Mercy&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Wherefore
she said within herself, I will yet have more talk with this Christiana,
and if I find truth and life in what she shall say, myself with all
my heart shall also go with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neighbour,&rdquo; spoke
out Mercy to Mrs. Timorous, &ldquo;I did indeed come with you to see
Christiana this morning, and since she is, as you see, a-taking of her
last farewell of her country, I think to walk this sunshine morning
a little way with her to help her on the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she told
her not of her second reason, but kept that to herself.&nbsp; I would
fain go on with Mercy&rsquo;s memoirs all night.&nbsp; But you will
take up that inviting thread for yourselves.&nbsp; And meantime I shall
stop here and gather up under two or three heads some of the more memorable
results and lessons of that sunshine-morning call.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, to begin with, there was something quite queen-like,
something absolutely commanding, about Christiana&rsquo;s look and manner,
as well as about all she said and did that morning.&nbsp; Mercy&rsquo;s
morning companion had all the advantages that dress and equipage could
give her; while Christiana stood in the middle of the floor in her housewife&rsquo;s
clothes, covered with dust and surrounded with all her dismantled house;
but, with all that, there was something about Christiana that took Mercy&rsquo;s
heart completely captive.&nbsp; All that Christiana had by this time
come through had blanched her cheek and whitened her hair: but all that
only the more commanded Mercy&rsquo;s sensitive and noble soul.&nbsp;
To be open to impressions of that kind is one of the finest endowments
of a finely endowed nature; and, all through, the attentive reader of
her history will be sure to remark and imitate Mercy&rsquo;s exquisite
and tenacious sensibility to all that is true and good, upright and
honourable and noble.&nbsp; And then, what a blessing it is to a girl
of Mercy&rsquo;s mould to meet at opening womanhood with another woman,
be it a mother, a mistress, or a neighbour, whose character then, and
as life goes on, can supply the part of the supporting and sheltering
oak to the springing and clinging vine.&nbsp; Christiana being now the
new woman she was, as well as a woman of great natural wisdom, dignity,
and stability of character, the safety, the salvation of poor motherless
Mercy was as good as sure.&nbsp; Indeed, all Mercy&rsquo;s subsequent
history is only one long and growing tribute to the worth, the constant
love, and the sleepless solicitude of this true mother in Israel.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Now, it was so, that, wholly unknown to all her companions,
young and old, in her own very remarkable words, Mercy had for a long
time been hungering with all her heart to meet with some genuinely good
people,&mdash;with some people, as she said herself,&mdash;&ldquo;of
truth and of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are remarkable words to hear drop
from the lips of a young girl, and especially a girl of Mercy&rsquo;s
environment.&nbsp; Now, had there been anything hollow, had there been
one atom of insincerity or exaggeration about Christiana that morning,
had she talked too much, had all her actions not far more than borne
out all her words, had there not been in the broken-hearted woman a
depth of mind and a warmth of heart far beyond all her words, Mercy
would never have become a pilgrim.&nbsp; But the natural dignity of
Christiana&rsquo;s character; her capable, commanding, resolute ways;
the reality, even to agony, of her sorrow for her past life&mdash;all
taken together with her iron-fast determination to enter at once on
a new life&mdash;all that carried Mercy&rsquo;s heart completely captive.&nbsp;
Mercy felt that there was a solemnity, an awesomeness, and a mystery
about her new friend&rsquo;s experiences and memories that it was not
for a child like herself to attempt to intrude into.&nbsp; But, all
the more because of that, a spell of love and fear and reverence lay
on Mercy&rsquo;s heart and mind all her after-days from that so solemn
and so eventful morning when she first saw Christiana&rsquo;s haggard
countenance and heard her remorseful cries.&nbsp; My so churlish carriages
to him!&nbsp; Now, such carriages between man and wife had often pained
and made ashamed Mercy&rsquo;s maidenly heart beyond all expression.&nbsp;
Till she had sometimes said to herself, blushing with shame before herself
as she said it, that if ever she was a wife&mdash;may my tongue cleave
to the roof of my mouth before I say one churlish word to him who is
my husband!&nbsp; And thus it was that nothing that Christiana said
that morning in the uprush of her remorse moved Mercy more with pity
and with love than just what Christiana beat her breast about as concerning
her lost husband.&nbsp; Mercy used to say that she saw truth and life
enough in one hour that morning to sober and to solemnise and to warn
her to set a watch on the door of her lips for all her after-days.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Before Mrs. Timorous was well out of the door, Mercy had
already plucked off her gloves, and hung up her morning bonnet on a
nail in the wall, so much did her heart heave to help the cumbered widow
and her fatherless children.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou wilt, I will hire
thee,&rdquo; said Christiana, &ldquo;and thou shalt go with me as my
servant.&nbsp; Yet we will have all things common betwixt thee and me;
only, now thou art here, go along with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this Mercy
fell on Christiana&rsquo;s neck and kissed her mother; for after that
morning Christiana had always a daughter of her own, and Mercy a mother.&nbsp;
And you may be sure, with two such women working with all their might,
all things were soon ready for their happy departure.</p>
<p>Mr. Kerr Bain invites his readers to compare John Bunyan&rsquo;s
Mercy at this point with William Law&rsquo;s Miranda.&nbsp; I shall
not tarry to draw out the full comparison here, but shall content myself
with simply repeating Mr. Bain&rsquo;s happy reference.&nbsp; Only,
I shall not content myself till all to whom my voice can reach, and
who are able to enjoy only a first-rate book, have Mr. Bain&rsquo;s
book beside their <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; That morning,
then, on which Mrs. Timorous, having nothing to do at home, set out
with Mercy on a round of calls&mdash;that was Mercy&rsquo;s last idle
morning for all her days.&nbsp; For her mind was, ever after that, to
be always busying of herself in doing, for when she had nothing to do
for herself she would be making of hosen and garments for others, and
would bestow them upon those that had need.&nbsp; I will warrant her
a good housewife, quoth Mr. Brisk to himself.&nbsp; So much so that
at any place they stopped on the way, even for a day and a night to
rest and refresh themselves, Mercy would seek out all the poor and all
the old people, and ere ever she was aware what she was doing, already
a good report had spread abroad concerning the pilgrims and their pilgrimage.&nbsp;
At the same time, it must be told that poor Mercy&rsquo;s heart was
more heavy for the souls of the poor people than for their naked bodies
and hungry bellies.&nbsp; So much was this so that when the shepherds,
Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere, took her to a place where
she saw one Fool and one Want-wit washing of an Ethiopian with intention
to make him white, but the more they washed him the blacker he was,
Mercy blushed and felt guilty before the shepherds,&mdash;she so took
home to her charitable heart the bootless work of Fool and Want-wit.&nbsp;
Mercy put on the Salvationist bonnet at her first outset to the Celestial
City, and she never put it off till she came to that land where there
are no more poor to make hosen and hats for, and no more Ethiopians
to take to the fountain.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; There are not a few young communicants here to-night, as
well as not a few who are afraid as yet to offer themselves for the
Lord&rsquo;s table; and, as it so falls out to-night, Mercy&rsquo;s
case contains both an encouragement and an example to all such.&nbsp;
For never surely had a young communicant less to go upon than Mercy
had that best morning of all her life.&nbsp; For she had nothing to
go upon but a great desire to help Christiana with her work; some desire
for truth and for life; and some first and feeble yearnings over her
own soul,&mdash;yearnings, however, that she kept entirely to herself.&nbsp;
That was all.&nbsp; She had no remorses like those which had ploughed
up Christiana&rsquo;s cheeks into such channels of tears.&nbsp; She
had no dark past out of which swarms of hornets stung her guilty conscience.&nbsp;
Nor on the other hand, had she any such sweet dreams and inviting visions
as those that were sent to cheer and encourage the disconsolate widow.&nbsp;
She will have her own sweet dreams yet, that will make her laugh loud
out in her sleep.&nbsp; But that will be long after this, when she has
discovered how hard her heart is and how great God&rsquo;s grace is.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How shall I be ascertained,&rdquo; she put it to Christiana,
&ldquo;that I also shall be entertained?&nbsp; Had I but this hope,
from one that can tell, I would make no stick at all, but would go,
being helped by Him that can help, though the way was never so tedious.&nbsp;
Had I as good hope for a loving reception as you have, I think no Slough
of Despond would discourage me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
the other, &ldquo;you know your sore, and I know mine; and, good friend,
we shall all have enough evil before we come to our journey&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; And soon after that, of all places on the upward way,
Mercy&rsquo;s evil began at the Wicket Gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a companion,&rdquo;
said Christiana, &ldquo;that stands without.&nbsp; One that is much
dejected in her mind, for that she comes, as she thinks, without sending
for; whereas I was sent to by my husband&rsquo;s King.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the porter opened the gate and looked out; but Mercy was fallen down
in a swoon, for she fainted and was afraid that the gate would not be
opened to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am faint;
there is scarce life left in me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he answered her that
one once said, &ldquo;When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the
Lord, and my prayer came in into Thee, into Thy holy temple.&nbsp; Fear
not, but stand up upon thy feet, and tell me wherefore thou art come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am come, sir, into that for which I never was invited, as my
friend Christiana was.&nbsp; Her invitation was from the Lord, and mine
was but from her.&nbsp; Wherefore, I fear that I presume.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then said he to those that stood by, &ldquo;Fetch something and give
it to Mercy to smell on, thereby to stay her fainting.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So they fetched her a bundle of myrrh, and a while after she revived.&mdash;Let
young communicants be content with Mercy&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp; She
started for the City just because she liked to be beside a good woman
who was starting thither.&nbsp; She wished to help a good woman who
was going thither; and just a little desire began at first to awaken
in her heart to go to the city too.&nbsp; Till, having once set her
face to go up, one thing after another worked together to lead her up
till she, too, had her life full of those invitations and experiences
and interests and occupations and enjoyments that make Mercy&rsquo;s
name so memorable, and her happy case such an example and such an inspiration,
to all God-fearing young women especially.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; John Bunyan must be held responsible for the strong dash
of romance that he so boldly throws into Mercy&rsquo;s memoirs.&nbsp;
But I shall postpone Mr. Brisk and his love-making and his answer to
another lecture.&nbsp; I shall not enter on Mercy&rsquo;s love matters
here at all, but shall leave them to be read at home by those who like
to read romances.&nbsp; Only, since we have seen so much of Mercy as
a maiden, one longs to see how she turned out as a wife.&nbsp; I can
only imagine how Mercy turned out as a wife; but there is a picture
of a Scottish Covenanting girl as a married wife which always rises
up before my mind when I think of Mercy&rsquo;s matronly days.&nbsp;
That picture might hang in Bunyan&rsquo;s own peculiar gallery, so beautiful
is the drawing, and so warm and so eloquent the colouring.&nbsp; Take,
then, this portrait of one of the daughters of the Scottish Covenant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was a woman of great worth, whom I therefore passionately
loved and inwardly honoured.&nbsp; A stately, beautiful, and comely
personage; truly pious and fearing the Lord.&nbsp; Of an evenly temper,
patient in our common tribulations and under her personal distresses.&nbsp;
A woman of bright natural parts, and of an uncommon stock of prudence;
of a quick and lively apprehension in things she applied herself to,
and of great presence of mind in surprising incidents.&nbsp; Sagacious
and acute in discerning the qualities of persons, and therefore not
easily imposed upon.&nbsp; [See Mr. Brisk&rsquo;s interviews with Mercy.]&nbsp;
Modest and grave in her deportment, but naturally cheerful; wise and
affable in conversation, also having a good faculty at speaking and
expressing herself with assurance.&nbsp; Being a pattern of frugality
and wise management in household affairs, all such were therefore entirely
committed to her; well fitted for and careful of the virtuous education
of her children; remarkably useful in the countryside, both in the Merse
and in the Forest, through her skill in physic and surgery, which in
many instances a peculiar blessing appeared to be commanded upon from
heaven.&nbsp; And, finally, a crown to me in my public station and pulpit
appearances.&nbsp; During the time we have lived together we have passed
through a sea of trouble, as yet not seeing the shore but afar off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
him.&nbsp; What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the
son of my vows?&nbsp; Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is
far above rubies.&nbsp; Her children arise up and call her blessed;
her husband also, and he praiseth her.&nbsp; Favour is deceitful, and
beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MR. BRISK</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be ye not unequally yoked.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were some severe precisians in John Bunyan&rsquo;s day who
took the objection to the author of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>
that he sometimes laughed too loud.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One may (I think) say, both he laughs and cries,<br />
May well be guessed at by his watery eyes.<br />
Some things are of that nature as to make<br />
One&rsquo;s fancy chuckle while his heart doth ake.<br />
When Jacob saw his Rachel with the sheep,<br />
At the same time he did both laugh and weep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even Dr. Cheever, in his excellent lectures on the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>, confesses that though the Second Part never ceases for
a moment to tell the serious story of the Pilgrimage, at the same time,
it sometimes becomes so merry as almost to pass over into absolute comedy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is one passage,&rdquo; says Cheever, &ldquo;which for exquisite
humour, quiet satire, and naturalness in the development of character
is scarcely surpassed in the language.&nbsp; It is the account of the
courtship between Mr. Brisk and Mercy which took place at the House
Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the insertion of such an episode as that of Mr. Brisk into such
a book as the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> is only yet another proof
of the health, the strength, and the truth to nature of John Bunyan&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; His was eminently an honest, straightforward, manly, English
understanding.&nbsp; A smaller man would not have ventured on Mr. Brisk
in such a book as the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; But there
is no affectation, there is no prudery, there is no superiority to nature
in John Bunyan.&nbsp; He knew quite well that of the thousands of men
and women who were reading his <i>Pilgrim</i> there was no subject,
not even religion itself, that was taking up half so much of their thoughts
as just love-making and marriage.&nbsp; And, like the wise man and the
true teacher he was, he here points out to all his readers how well
true religion and the fullest satisfaction of the warmest and the most
universal of human affections can be both harmonised and made mutually
helpful.&nbsp; In Bunyan&rsquo;s day love was too much left to the playwrights,
just as in our day it is too much left to the poets and the novelists.&nbsp;
And thus it is that in too many instances affection and passion have
taken full possession of the hearts and the lives of our young people
before any moral or religious lesson on these all-important subjects
has been given to them: any lesson such as John Bunyan so winningly
and so beautifully gives here.&nbsp; &ldquo;This incident,&rdquo; says
Thomas Scott, &ldquo;is very properly introduced, and it is replete
with instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Brisk, to begin with, was, so we are told, a young man of
some breeding,&mdash;that is to say, he was a young man of some social
position, some education, and of a certain good manner, at least on
the surface.&nbsp; In David Scott&rsquo;s Illustrations Mr. Brisk stands
before us a handsome and well-dressed young man of the period, with
his well-belted doublet, his voluminous ruffles, his heavily-studded
cuffs, his small cane, his divided hair, and his delicate hand,&mdash;altogether
answering excellently to his name, were it not for the dashed look of
surprise with which he gets his answer, and, with what jauntiness he
can at the moment command, takes his departure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Brisk
was a man of some breeding,&rdquo; says Bunyan, &ldquo;and that pretended
to religion; but a man that stuck very close to the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That Mr. Brisk made any pretence to religion at any other time and in
any other place is not said; only that he put on that pretence with
his best clothes when he came once or twice or more to Mercy and offered
love to her at the House Beautiful.&nbsp; The man with the least religion
at other times, even the man with no pretence to religion at other times
at all, will pretend to some religion when he is in love with a young
woman of Mercy&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; And yet it would not be fair to say
that it is all pretence even in such a man at such a time.&nbsp; Grant
that a man is really in love; then, since all love is of the nature
of religion, for the time, the true lover is really on the borders of
a truly religious life.&nbsp; It may with perfect truth be said of all
men when they first fall in love that they are, for the time, not very
far away from the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; For all love is good, so
far as it goes.&nbsp; God is Love; and all love, in the long-run, has
a touch of the divine nature in it.&nbsp; And for once, if never again,
every man who is deeply in love has a far-off glimpse of the beauty
of holiness, and a far-off taste of that ineffable sweetness of which
the satisfied saints of God sing so ecstatically.&nbsp; But, in too
many instances, a young man&rsquo;s love having been kindled only by
the creature, and, never rising from her to his and her Creator, as
a rule, it sooner or later burns low and at last burns out, and leaves
nothing but embers and ashes in his once so ardent heart.&nbsp; Mr.
Brisk&rsquo;s love-making might have ended in his becoming a pilgrim
but for this fatal flaw in his heart, that even in his love-making he
stuck so fast to the world.&nbsp; It is almost incredible: you may well
refuse to believe it&mdash;that any young man in love, and especially
a young gentleman of Mr. Brisk&rsquo;s breeding, would approach his
mistress with the question how much she could earn a day.&nbsp; As Mr.
Brisk looks at Mercy&rsquo;s lap so full of hats and hosen and says
it, I can see his natty cane beginning to lengthen itself out in his
soft-skinned hand and to send out teeth like a muck-rake.&nbsp; Give
Mr. Brisk another thirty years or so and he will be an ancient churl,
raking to himself the sticks and the straws and the dust of the earth,
neither looking up to nor regarding the celestial crown that is still
offered to him in exchange for his instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mercy was of a fair countenance, and, therefore, all
the more alluring.&rdquo;&nbsp; But her fair countenance was really
no temptation to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit still, my daughter,&rdquo; said
Naomi to Ruth in the Old Testament.&nbsp; And it was entirely Mercy&rsquo;s
maidenly nature to sit still.&nbsp; Even before she had come to her
full womanhood under Christiana&rsquo;s motherly care she would have
been an example to Ruth.&nbsp; Long ago, while Mercy was still a mere
girl, when Mrs. Light-mind said something to her one day that made her
blush, Mercy at last looked up in real anger and said, We women should
be wooed; we were not made to woo.&nbsp; And thus it was that all their
time at the House Beautiful Mercy stayed close at home and worked with
her needle and thread just as if she had been the plainest girl in all
the town.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might have had husbands afore now,&rdquo; she
said, with a cast of her head over the coat that lay on her lap, &ldquo;though
I spake not of it to any.&nbsp; But they were such as did not like my
conditions, though never did any of them find fault with my person.&nbsp;
So they and I could not agree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once Mercy&rsquo;s mouth
was opened on the subject of possible husbands it is a miracle that
she did not go on in confidence to name some of the husbands she might
have had.&nbsp; Mercy was too truthful and too honourable a maiden to
have said even on that subject what she did say if it had not been true.&nbsp;
No doubt she believed it true.&nbsp; And the belief so long as she mentioned
no names, did not break any man&rsquo;s bones and did not spoil any
man&rsquo;s market.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t set up too prudishly and say that
it is a pity that Mercy so far forgot herself as to make her little
confidential boast.&nbsp; We would not have had her without that little
boast.&nbsp; Keep-at-home, sit-still, hats and hosen and all&mdash;her
little boast only proves Mercy to have been at heart a true daughter
of Eve after all.</p>
<p>There is an old-fashioned word that comes up again and again in the
account of Mr. Brisk&rsquo;s courtship,&mdash;a word that contains far
more interest and instruction for us than might on the surface appear.&nbsp;
When Mr. Brisk was rallied upon his ill-success with Mercy, he was wont
to say that undoubtedly Mistress Mercy was a very pretty lass, only
she was troubled with ill conditions.&nbsp; And then, when Mercy was
confiding to Prudence all about her possible husbands, she said that
they were all such as did not like her conditions.&nbsp; To which Prudence,
keeping her countenance, replied, that the men were but few in their
day that could abide the practice that was set forth by such conditions
as those of Mercy.&nbsp; Well, tossed out Mercy, if nobody will have
me I will die a maid, or my conditions shall be to me as a husband!&nbsp;
As I came again and again across that old seventeenth-century word &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo;
I said to myself, I feel sure that Dr. Murray of the Oxford Scriptorium
will have noted this striking passage.&nbsp; And on turning up the Sixth
Part of the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, there, to be sure, was the
old word standing in this present setting.&nbsp; Five long, rich, closely
packed columns stood under the head of &ldquo;Condition&rdquo;; and
amid a thousand illustrations of its use, the text: &ldquo;1684, Bunyan,
Pilgr., ii. 84.&nbsp; He said that Mercy was a pretty lass, but troubled
with ill conditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor illiterate John Bunyan stood
in the centre of a group of learned and famous men, composed of Chaucer,
Wyclif, Skelton, Palsgrave, Raleigh, Featly, Richard Steel, and Walter
Scott&mdash;all agreeing in their use of our word, and all supplying
examples of its use in the best English books.&nbsp; By Mercy&rsquo;s
conditions, then, is just meant her cast of mind, her moral nature,
her temper and her temperament, her dispositions and her inclinations,
her habits of thought, habits of heart, habits of life, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mercy proudly, &ldquo;if nobody will have
me, I will die a maid, or my conditions shall be to me as a husband.&nbsp;
For I cannot change my nature, and to have one that lies cross to me
in this,&mdash;that I purpose never to admit of as long as I live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By this time, though she is still little more than a girl, Mercy had
her habits formed, her character cast, and, more than all, her whole
heart irrevocably set on her soul&rsquo;s salvation.&nbsp; And everything&mdash;husband
and children and all&mdash;must condition themselves to that, else she
will have none of them.&nbsp; She had sought first the kingdom of God
and His righteousness, and she will seek nothing, she will accept nothing&mdash;no,
not even a husband&mdash;who crosses her choice in that.&nbsp; She has
chosen her life, and her husband with it.&nbsp; Not the man as yet,
but the whole manner of the man.&nbsp; The conditions of the man, as
she said about herself; else she will boldly and bravely die a maid.&nbsp;
And there are multitudes of married women who, when they read this page
about Mercy, will gnash their teeth at the madness of their youth, and
will wildly wish that they only were maids again; and, then, like Mercy,
they would take good care to make for themselves husbands of their own
conditions too&mdash;of their own means, their own dispositions, inclinations,
tastes, and pursuits.&nbsp; For, according as our conditions to one
another are or are not in our marriages,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They locally contain or heaven or hell;<br />
There is no third place in them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What untold good, then, may all our young women not get out of the
loving study of Mercy&rsquo;s sweet, steadfast, noble character!&nbsp;
And what untold misery may they not escape!&nbsp; From first to last&mdash;and
we are not yet come to her last&mdash;I most affectionately recommend
Mercy to the hearts and minds of all young women here.&nbsp; Single
and married; setting out on pilgrimage and steadfastly persevering in
it; sitting still till the husband with the right conditions comes,
and then rising up with her warm, well-kept heart to meet him&mdash;if
any maiden here has no mother, or no elder sister, or no wise and prudent
friend like Prudence or Christiana to take counsel of&mdash;and even
if she has&mdash;let Mercy be her meditation and her model through all
her maidenly days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Mercy, &ldquo;I will look no more on
him, for I purpose never to have a clog to my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; A pungent
resolve for every husband to read and to think to himself about, who
has married a wife with a soul.&nbsp; Let all husbands who have such
wives halt here and ask themselves with some imagination as to what
may sometimes go on, at communion times, say, in the souls of their
wives.&nbsp; It is not every wife, it is true, who has a soul to clog;
but some of our wives have.&nbsp; Well, now, let us ask ourselves: How
do we stand related to their souls?&nbsp; Do our wives, when examining
the state of their souls since they married us, have to say that at
one time they had hoped to be further on in the life of the soul than
they yet are?&nbsp; And are they compelled before God to admit that
the marriage they have made, and would make, has terribly hindered them?&nbsp;
Would they have been better women, would they have been living a better
life, and doing far more good in the world, if they had taken their
maidenly ideals, like Mercy, for a husband?&nbsp; Let us sometimes imagine
ourselves into the secrets of our wives&rsquo; souls, and ask if they
ever feel that they are unequally and injuriously yoked in their deepest
and best life.&nbsp; Do we ever see a tear falling in secret, or hear
a stolen sigh heaved, or stumble on them at a stealthy prayer?&nbsp;
A Roman lady on being asked why she sometimes let a sob escape her and
a tear fall, when she had such a gentleman of breeding and rank and
riches to her husband, touched her slipper with her finger and said:
&ldquo;Is not that a well-made, a neat, and a costly shoe?&nbsp; And
yet you would not believe how it pinches and pains me sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some every whit as good women as Mercy was have purposed as nobly
and as firmly as Mercy did, and yet have wakened up, when it was too
late, to find that, with all their high ideals, and with all their prudence,
their husband is not in himself, and is not to them, what they at one
time felt sure he would be.&nbsp; Mercy had a sister named Bountiful,
who made that mistake and that dreadful discovery; and what Mercy had
seen of married life in her sister&rsquo;s house almost absolutely turned
her against marriage altogether.&nbsp; &ldquo;The one thing certain,&rdquo;
says Thomas Mozley in his chapter on Ideal Wife and Husband, &ldquo;is
that both wife and husband are different in the result from the expectation.&nbsp;
Age, illness, an increasing family, no family at all, household cares,
want of means, isolation, incompatible prejudices, quarrels, social
difficulties, and such like, all tell on married people, and make them
far other than they once promised to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; When that awakening
comes there is only one solace, and women take to that supreme solace
much more often than men.&nbsp; And that solace, as you all know, is
true, if too late, religion.&nbsp; And even where true religion has
already been, there is still a deeper and a more inward religion suited
to the new experiences and the new needs of life.&nbsp; And if both
husband and wife in such a crisis truly betake themselves to Him who
gathereth the solitary into families, the result will be such a remarriage
of depth and tenderness, loyalty and mutual help, as their early dreams
never came within sight of.&nbsp; Not early love, not children, not
plenty of means, not all the best amenities of married life taken together,
will repair a marriage and keep a marriage in repair for one moment
like a living and an intense faith in God; a living and an intense love
to God; and then that faith in and love for one another that spring
out of God and out of His love alone.</p>

<p>With infinite delicacy John Bunyan here tells us the sad story of
Matthew&rsquo;s sore sickness at the House Beautiful.&nbsp; The cause
of the sore sickness, its symptoms, its serious nature, and its complete
cures are all told with the utmost plainness; but, at the same time,
with the most exquisite delicacy.&nbsp; Bunyan calls the ancient physician
who is summoned in and who effects the cure, Mr. Skill, but you must
believe that Bunyan himself is Mr. Skill; and I question if this skilful
writer ever wrote a more skilful page than just this page that now lies
open before him who has the eyes to read it.</p>
<p>Matthew, it must always be remembered, was by this time a young man.&nbsp;
He was the eldest son of Christiana his mother, and for some time now
she had been a sorely burdened widow.&nbsp; Matthew&rsquo;s father was
no longer near his son to watch over him and to warn him against the
temptations and the dangers that wait on opening manhood.&nbsp; And
thus his mother, with all her other cares, had to be both father and
mother to her eldest son; and, with all her good sense and all her long
and close acquaintance with the world, she was too fond a mother to
suspect any evil of her eldest son.&nbsp; And thus it was that Christiana
had nearly lost her eldest son before her eyes were open to the terrible
dangers he had for a long time been running.&nbsp; For it was so, that
the upward way that this household without a head had to travel lay
through a land full of all kinds of dangers both to the bodies and to
the souls of such travellers as they were.&nbsp; And what well-nigh
proved a fatal danger to Matthew lay right in his way.&nbsp; It was
Beelzebub&rsquo;s orchard.&nbsp; Not that this young man&rsquo;s way
lay through that orchard exactly; yet, walled up as was that orchard
with all its forbidden fruit, that evil fruit would hang over the wall
so that if any lusty youth wished to taste it, he had only to reach
up to the over-hanging branches and plash down on himself some of the
forbidden bunches.&nbsp; Now, that was just what Matthew had done.&nbsp;
Till we have him lying at the House Beautiful, not only not able to
enjoy the delights of the House and of the season, but so pained in
his bowels and so pulled together with inward pains, that he sometimes
cried out as if he were being torn to pieces.&nbsp; At that moment Mr.
Skill, the ancient physician, entered the sick-room, when, having a
little observed Matthew&rsquo;s intense agony, with a certain mixture
of goodness and severity he recited these professional verses over the
trembling bed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O conscience, who can stand against thy power?<br />
Endure thy gripes and agonies one hour?<br />
Stone, gout, strappado, racks, whatever is<br />
Dreadful to sense, are only toys to this&mdash;<br />
No pleasures, riches, honours, friends can tell<br />
How to give ease to this, &rsquo;tis like to hell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, turning to the sick man&rsquo;s mother, who stood at the
bed&rsquo;s head wringing her hands, the ancient leech said to her:
&ldquo;This boy of yours has been tampering with the forbidden fruit!&rdquo;&nbsp;
At which the angry mother turned on the well-approved physician as if
he had caused all the trouble that he had come to cure.&nbsp; But the
ancient man knew both the son and the mother too, and therefore he addressed
her with some asperity: &ldquo;I tell you both that strong measures
must be taken instantly, else he will die.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Mr. Skill
had seen that the first purge was too weak, he made him one to the purpose;
and it was made, as he so learnedly said, <i>ex carne et sanguine Christi</i>.&nbsp;
The pills were to be taken three at a time, fasting, in half a quarter
of a pint of the tears of repentance.&nbsp; After some coaxing, such
as mothers know best how to use, Matthew took the medicine and was soon
walking about again with a staff, and was able to go from room to room
of the hospitable and happy house.&nbsp; Understandest thou what thou
readest? said Philip the deacon to Queen Candace&rsquo;s treasurer as
he sat down beside him in the chariot and opened up to him the fifty-third
of the prophet Isaiah.&nbsp; And, understandest thou what thou here
readest in Matthew and Mr. Skill?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, on this almost too closely veiled case I shall venture
to remark, in the first place, that multitudes of boys grow up into
young men, and go out of our most godly homes and into a whole world
of temptation without due warning being given them as to where they
are going.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do marvel that none did warn him of it,&rdquo;
said Mr. Skill, with some anger.&nbsp; What Matthew&rsquo;s father might
have done in this matter had he been still in this world when his son
became a man in it we can only guess.&nbsp; As it was, it never entered
his mother&rsquo;s too fond mind to take her fatherless boy by himself
when she saw Beelzebub&rsquo;s orchard before him, and tell him what
Solomon told his son, and to point out to him the prophecy that King
Lemuel&rsquo;s mother prophesied to her son.&nbsp; Poor Matthew was
a young man before his mother was aware of it.&nbsp; And, poor woman,
she only found that out when Mr. Skill was in the sick-room and was
looking at her with eyes that seemed to say to her that she had murdered
her child.&nbsp; She had loved too long to look on her first-born as
still a child.&nbsp; When he went at any time for a season out of her
sight, she had never followed him with her knowledge of the world; she
had never prevented him with an awakened and an anxious imagination;
till now she had got him home with no rest in his bones because of his
sin.&nbsp; And then she began to cry too late, O naughty boy, and, O
careless mother, what shall I do for my son!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;That food, to wit, that fruit,&rdquo; said Mr. Skill,
&ldquo;is even the most hurtful of all.&nbsp; It is the fruit of Beelzebub&rsquo;s
orchard.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it is.&nbsp; There is no fruit that hurts at
all like that fruit.&nbsp; How it hurts at the time, we see in Matthew&rsquo;s
sick-room; and how it hurts all a man&rsquo;s after days we see in Jacob,
and in Job, and in David, and in a thousand sin-sick souls of whose
psalms of remorse and repentance the world cannot contain all the books
that should be written.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet I marvel,&rdquo; said the
indignant physician, &ldquo;that none did warn him of it; many have
died thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh if I could but get the ears of all the
sons of godly fathers and mothers who are beginning to tamper with Beelzebub&rsquo;s
orchard-trees, I feel as if I could warn them to-night, and out of this
text, of what they are doing!&nbsp; I have known so many who have died
thereof.&nbsp; Oh if I could but save them in time from those gripes
of conscience that will pull them to pieces on the softest and the most
fragrant bed that shall ever be made for them on earth!&nbsp; It will
be well with them if they do not lie down torn to pieces on their bed
in hell, and curse the day they first plashed down into their youthful
hands the vine of Sodom.&nbsp; Both the way to hell and the way to heaven
are full of many kinds of hurtful fruits; but that species of fruit
that poor misguided Matthew plucked and ate after he had well passed
the gate that is at the head of the way is, by all men&rsquo;s testimony,
by far the most hurtful of all forbidden fruits.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The whole scene in Matthew&rsquo;s sick-room reads, after
all, less like a skilful invention than a real occurrence.&nbsp; Inventive
and realistic as John Bunyan is, there is surely something here that
goes beyond even his genius.&nbsp; After making all allowance for Bunyan&rsquo;s
unparalleled powers of creation and narration, I am inclined to think,
the oftener I read it, that, after all, we have not so much John Bunyan
here as very Nature herself.&nbsp; Yes; John Gifford surely was Mr.
Skill.&nbsp; Sister Bosworth surely was Matthew&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
And Matthew himself was Sister Bosworth&rsquo;s eldest son, while one
John Bunyan, a travelling tinker, was busy with his furnaces and his
soldering-irons in Dame Bosworth&rsquo;s kitchen.&nbsp; Young Bunyan,
with all his blackguardism, had never plashed down Beelzebub&rsquo;s
orchard.&nbsp; He swears he never did, and we are bound to believe him.&nbsp;
But young Bosworth had been tampering with the forbidden fruit, and
Gifford saw at a glance what was wrong.&nbsp; John Gifford was first
an officer in the Royalist army, then a doctor in Bedford, and now a
Baptist Puritan pastor; and the young tinker looked up to Gifford as
the most wonderful man for learning in books and in bodies and souls
of men in all the world.&nbsp; And when Gifford talked over young Bosworth&rsquo;s
bed half to himself and half to them about a medicine made <i>ex carne
et sanguine Christi</i>, the future author of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> never forgot the phrase.&nbsp; At a glance Gifford saw
what was the whole matter with the sick man.&nbsp; And painful as the
truth was to the sick man&rsquo;s mother, and humiliating with a life-long
humiliation to the sick man himself, Gifford was not the man or the
minister to beat about the bush at such a solemn moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
boy has been tampering with that which will kill him unless he gets
it taken off his conscience and out of his heart immediately.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, this same divination into our pastoral cases is by far and away
the most difficult part of a minister&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; It is easy
and pleasant with a fluent tongue to get through our pulpit work; but
to descend the pulpit stairs and deal with life, and with this and that
sin in the lives of our people,&mdash;that is another matter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must labour,&rdquo; says Richard Baxter in his <i>Reformed
Pastor</i>, &ldquo;to be acquainted with the state of all our people
as fully as we can; both to know the persons and their inclinations
and conversation; to know what sins they are most in danger of, what
duties they neglect, and what temptations they are most liable to.&nbsp;
For, if we know not their temperament or their disease, we are likely
to prove but unsuccessful physicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when we begin
to reform our pastorate to that pattern, we are soon compelled to set
down such entries in our secret diary as that of Thomas Shepard of Harvard
University: &ldquo;Sabbath, 5th April 1641.&nbsp; Nothing I do, nay,
none under my shadow prosper.&nbsp; I so want wisdom for my place, and
to guide others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; for what wisdom is needed for the
place of a minister like John Gifford, John Bunyan, Richard Baxter,
and Thomas Shepard!&nbsp; What wisdom, what divine genius, to dive into
and divine the secret history of a soul from a twinge of conscience,
even from a drop of the eye, a tone of the voice, or a gesture of the
hand or of the head!&nbsp; And yet, with some natural taste for the
holy work, with study, with experience, and with life-long expert reading,
even a plain minister with no genius, but with some grace and truth,
may come to great eminence in the matters of the soul.&nbsp; And then,
with what an interest, solemn and awful, with what a sleepless interest
such a pastor goes about among his diseased, sin-torn, and scattered
flock!&nbsp; All their souls are naked and open under his divining eye.&nbsp;
They need not to tell him where they ail, and of what sickness they
are nigh unto death.&nbsp; That food, he says, with some sternness over
their sick-bed, I warned you of it; I told you with all plainness that
many have died of eating that fruit!&nbsp; &ldquo;We must be ready,&rdquo;
Baxter continues, &ldquo;to give advice to those that come to us with
cases of conscience.&nbsp; A minister is not only for public preaching,
but to be a known counsellor for his people&rsquo;s souls as the lawyer
is for their estates, and the physician is for their bodies.&nbsp; And
because the people are grown unacquainted with this office of the ministry,
and their own necessity and duty herein, it belongeth to us to acquaint
them herewith, and to press them publicly to come to us for advice concerning
their souls.&nbsp; We must not only be willing of the trouble, but draw
it upon ourselves by inviting them hereto.&nbsp; To this end it is very
necessary to be acquainted with practical cases and able to assist them
in trying their states.&nbsp; One word of seasonable and prudent advice
hath done that good that many sermons would not have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As he went on pounding and preparing his well-approved pill,
the (at the bottom of his heart) kind old leech talked encouragingly
to the mother and to her sick son, and said: &ldquo;Come, come; after
all, do not he too much cast down.&nbsp; Had we lived in the days of
the old medicine, I would have been compounding a purge out of the blood
of a goat, and the ashes of an heifer, and the juice of hyssop.&nbsp;
But I have a far better medicine under my hands here.&nbsp; This moment
I will make you a purge to the purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the learned
man, half-doctor, half-divine, chanted again the sacred incantation
as he bent over his pestle and mortar, saying: <i>Ex carne et sanguine
Christi</i>!&nbsp; Those shrewd old eyes soon saw that, in spite of
all their defences and all their denials, damage had been done to the
conscience and the heart that nothing would set right but a frank admission
of the evil that had been done, and a prompt submission to the regimen
appointed and the medicine prepared.&nbsp; And how often we ministers
puddle and peddle with goat&rsquo;s blood and heifer&rsquo;s ashes and
hyssop juice when we should instantly prescribe stern fasting and secret
prayer and long spaces of repentance, and then the body and the blood
of Christ.&nbsp; How often our people cheat us into healing their hurt
slightly!&nbsp; How often they succeed in putting us off, after we are
called in, with their own account of their cases, and set us out on
a wild-goose chase!&nbsp; I myself have more than once presented young
men in their trouble with apologetic books, University sermons, and
watered-down explanations of the Confession and the Catechism, when,
had I known all I came afterwards to know, I would have sent them Bunyan&rsquo;s
<i>Sighs from Hell</i>.&nbsp; I have sent soul-sick women also <i>The
Bruised Reed</i>, and <i>The Mission of the Comforter</i> with sympathising
inscriptions, and sweet scriptures written inside, when, had I had Mr.
Skill&rsquo;s keen eyes in my stupid head, I would have gone to them
with the total abstinence pledge in my one hand, and Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s
<i>Holy Living and Dying</i> in my other.&nbsp; &ldquo;No diet but that
which is wholesome!&rdquo; almost in anger answered the sick man&rsquo;s
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; the honest leech replied, in
more anger, &ldquo;this boy has been tampering with Beelzebub&rsquo;s
orchard.&nbsp; And many have died of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It was while all the rest of the House Beautiful were supping
on lamb and wine, and while there was such music in the House that made
Mercy exclaim over it with wonder&mdash;it was at the smell of the supper
and at the sound of the psalmody that Matthew&rsquo;s gripes seized
upon him worse than ever.&nbsp; All the time the others sat late into
the night Matthew lay on the rack pulled to pieces.&nbsp; After William
Law&rsquo;s death at King&rsquo;s Cliffe, his executors found among
his most secret papers a prayer he had composed for his own alone use
on a certain communion day when he was self-debarred from the Lord&rsquo;s
table.&nbsp; I do not know for certain just what fruit the young non-juror
had stolen out of Beelzebub&rsquo;s orchard before that communion season;
but I can see that he was in poor Matthew&rsquo;s exact experience that
communion night,&mdash;literally torn to pieces with agonies of conscience
while all his fellow-worshippers were at the table of the Lord.&nbsp;
While the psalms and hymns are being sung at the supper-table, lay your
ear to Law&rsquo;s closet door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whilst all Thy faithful
servants are on this day offering to Thee the comfortable sacrifice
of the body and the blood of Christ, and feasting at that holy table
which Thou hast ordained for the refreshment, joy, and comfort of their
souls, I, unhappy wretch, full of guilt, am justly denied any share
of these comforts that are common to the Christian world.&nbsp; O my
God, I am an unclean worm, a dead dog, a stinking carcass, justly removed
from that society of saints who this day kneel about Thine altar.&nbsp;
But, oh! suffer me to look toward Thy holy Sanctuary; suffer my soul
again to be in the place where Thine honour dwelleth.&nbsp; Reject not
the sacrifice of a broken heart, and do Thou be with me in secret, though
I am not fit to appear in Thy public worship.&nbsp; Lord, if Thou wilt
Thou canst make me clean.&nbsp; Lord, speak but the word, and Thy servant
shall be healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the fruit of Beelzebub&rsquo;s orchard.&nbsp;
Many have died thereof.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir, make me up twelve boxes of them; for if
I can get these, I will never take other physic.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These
same pills,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;are good also to prevent diseases
as well as to cure when one is sick.&nbsp; But, good woman, thou must
take these pills no other way but as I have prescribed; for if you do,
they will do no good.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have taken one illustration from
William Law&rsquo;s life; I shall take another from that world of such
illustrations and so close.&nbsp; &ldquo;O God, let me never see such
another day as this.&nbsp; Let the dreadful punishment of this day never
be out of my mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it never was.&nbsp; For, after that
day in hell, Law never laid down his head on his pillow that he did
not seem to remember that dreadful day.&nbsp; William Law would have
satisfied Dr. Skill for a convalescent.&nbsp; For he never felt that
he had any right to touch the body and blood of Christ, either at communion
times, or a thousand times every day, till he had again got ready his
heart of true repentance.&nbsp; My brethren, self-destroyed out of Beelzebub&rsquo;s
orchard, and all my brethren, live a life henceforth of true repentance.&nbsp;
Not out of the sins of your youth only, but out of the best, the most
watchful, and the most blameless day you ever live, distil your half-pint
of repentance every night before you sleep.&nbsp; For, as dear old Skill
said, unless you do, neither flesh nor blood of Christ, nor anything
else, will do you any genuine good.</p>
<h2>THE SHEPHERD BOY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He humbled Himself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now as they were going along and talking, they espied a boy
feeding his father&rsquo;s sheep.&nbsp; The boy was in very mean clothes,
but of a very fresh and well-favoured countenance, and as he sat by
himself he sang.&nbsp; Hark, said Mr. Greatheart, to what the shepherd
boy saith.&nbsp; So they hearkened and he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that is down, needs fear no fall;<br />
He that is low no pride:<br />
He that is humble, ever shall<br />
Have God to be his guide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am content with what I have,<br />
Little be it or much:<br />
And, Lord, contentment still I crave,<br />
Because thou savest such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulness to such a burden is<br />
That go on pilgrimage:<br />
Here little, and hereafter bliss,<br />
Is best from age to age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then said their guide, Do you hear him?&nbsp; I will dare say that
this boy lives a merrier life and wears more of that herb called Heart&rsquo;s-ease
in his bosom than he that is clad in silk and velvet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, notwithstanding all that, nobody knew better than John Bunyan
knew, that no shepherd boy that ever lived on the face of the earth
ever sang that song; only one Boy ever sang that song, and He was not
the son of a shepherd at all, but the son of a carpenter.&nbsp; And,
saying that leads me on to say this before I begin, that I look for
a man of John Bunyan&rsquo;s inventive and sanctified genius to arise
some day, and armed also to boot with all our latest and best New Testament
studies.&nbsp; When that sorely-needed man so arises he will take us
back to Nazareth where that carpenter&rsquo;s Boy was brought up, and
he will let us see Him with our own eyes being brought up.&nbsp; He
will lead us into Mary&rsquo;s house on Sabbath days, and into Joseph&rsquo;s
workshop on week days, and he will show us the child Jesus, not so much
learning His letters and then putting on His carpenter&rsquo;s clothes,
as learning obedience by the things that He every day suffered.&nbsp;
That choice author will show us our Lord, both before He had discovered
Himself to be our Lord, as well as after He had made that great discovery,
always clothing Himself with humility as with a garment; taking up His
yoke of meekness and lowly-mindedness every day, and never for one moment
laying it down.&nbsp; When some writer with as holy an imagination as
that of John Bunyan, and with as sweet an English style, and with a
New Testament scholarship of the first order so arises, and so addresses
himself to the inward life of our Lord, what a blessing to our children
that writer will be!&nbsp; For he will make them see and feel just what
all that was in which our Lord&rsquo;s perfect humility consisted, and
how His perfect humility fulfilled itself in Him from day to day; up
through all His childhood days, school and synagogue days, workshop
and holy days, early manhood and mature manhood days; till He was so
meek in all His heart and so humble in all His mind that all men were
sent to Him to learn their meekness and their humility of Him.&nbsp;
I envy that gifted man the deep delight he will have in his work, and
the splendid reward he will have in the love and the debt of all coming
generations.&nbsp; Only, may he be really sent to us, and that soon!&nbsp;
Theodor Keim comes nearest a far-off glimpse of that eminent service
of any New Testament scholar I know.&nbsp; Jeremy Taylor and Thomas
Goodwin also, in their own time and in their own way, had occasional
inspirations toward this still-waiting treatment of the master-subject
of all learning and all genius&mdash;the inward sanctification, the
growth in grace, and then the self-discovery of the incarnate Son of
God.&nbsp; But, so let it please God, some contemporary scholar will
arise some day soon, combining in himself Goodwin&rsquo;s incomparable
Christology, and Taylor&rsquo;s incomparable eloquence, and Keim&rsquo;s
incomparably digested learning, with John Bunyan&rsquo;s incomparable
imagination and incomparable English style, and the waiting work will
be done, and theology for this life will take on its copestone.&nbsp;
In his absence, and till he comes, let us attempt a few annotations
to-night on this so-called shepherd boy&rsquo;s song in the Valley of
Humiliation.</p>
<blockquote><p>He that is down, needs fear no fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole scenery of the surrounding valley is set before us in that
single eloquent stanza.&nbsp; The sweet-voiced boy sits well off the
wayside as he sings his song to himself.&nbsp; He looks up to the hill-tops
that hang over his valley, and every shining tooth of those many hill-tops
has for him its own evil legend.&nbsp; He thinks he sees a little heap
of bleaching bones just under where that eagle hangs and wheels and
screams.&nbsp; Not one traveller through these perilous parts in a thousand
gets down those cruel rocks unhurt; and many travellers have been irrecoverably
lost among those deadly rocks, and have never received Christian burial.&nbsp;
All the shepherds&rsquo; cottages and all the hostel supper-tables for
many miles round are full of terrible stories of the Hill Difficulty
and the Descent Dangerous.&nbsp; And thus it is that this shepherd boy
looks up with such fear at those sharp peaks and shining precipices,
and lifts his fresh and well-favoured countenance to heaven and sings
again: &ldquo;He that is down, needs fear no fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Down
in his own esteem, that is.&nbsp; For this is a song of the heart rather
than of the highway.&nbsp; Down&mdash;safe, that is, from the steep
and slippery places of self-estimation, self-exaltation, self-satisfaction.&nbsp;
Down&mdash;so as to be delivered from all ambition and emulation and
envy.&nbsp; Down, and safe, thank God, from all pride, all high-mindedness,
and all stout-heartedness.&nbsp; Down from the hard and cruel hills,
and buried deep out of sight among those meadows where that herb grows
which is called Heart&rsquo;s-ease.&nbsp; Down, where the green pastures
grow and the quiet waters flow.&nbsp; No, indeed; he that is down into
this sweet bottom needs fear no fall.&nbsp; For there is nowhere here
for a man to fall from.&nbsp; And, even if he did fall, he would only
fall upon a fragrance-breathing bed of lilies.&nbsp; The very herbs
and flowers here would conspire to hold him up.&nbsp; Many a day, as
He grew up, the carpenter&rsquo;s son sat in that same valley and sang
that same song to His own humble and happy heart.&nbsp; He loved much
to be here.&nbsp; He loved also to walk these meadows, for He found
the air was pleasant.&nbsp; Methinks, He often said with Mercy, I am
as well in this valley as I have been anywhere else in My journey.&nbsp;
The place, methinks, suits with My spirit.&nbsp; I love to be in such
places where there is no rattling with coaches nor rumbling with wheels.&nbsp;
Methinks, also, here one may without much molestation be thinking what
he is, whence he came, and to what his King has called him.</p>
<blockquote><p>He that is low, no pride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low in his own eyes, that is.&nbsp; For pride goeth before destruction,
and a haughty spirit before a fall.&nbsp; Yes; but he who is low enough
already&mdash;none of the sure destructions that pride always works
shall ever come near to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The proud man,&rdquo; says
Sir Henry Taylor, &ldquo;is of all men the most vulnerable.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who
calls?&rsquo; asks the old shepherd in <i>As You Like It</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your betters,&rsquo; is the insolent answer.&nbsp; And what is
the shepherd&rsquo;s rejoinder?&nbsp; &lsquo;Else are they very wretched.&rsquo;&nbsp;
By what retort, reprisal, or repartee could it have been made half so
manifest that the insult had lighted upon armour of proof?&nbsp; Such
is the invincible independence and invulnerability of humility.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>He that is humble ever shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have God to be his guide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For thus saith the high and holy One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that
is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the heart of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones . . . All those things
hath Mine hand made, but to this man will I look, saith the Lord, even
to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembleth at My
word . . . Though the Lord be high, yet hath He respect unto the lowly;
but the proud He knoweth afar off . . . Likewise, ye younger, submit
yourselves unto the elder.&nbsp; Yea, all of you be subject one to another,
and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud and giveth
grace to the humble . . . Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes
lofty, neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too
high for me.&nbsp; Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child
that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child . .
. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&nbsp; For My yoke is
easy and My burden is light.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am content with what I have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little be it, or much:<br />
And, Lord, contentment still I crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou savest such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing this sweet singer is discontented with is his own
contentment.&nbsp; He will not be content as long as he has a shadow
of discontent left in his heart.&nbsp; And how blessed is such holy
discontent!&nbsp; For, would you know, asks Law, who is the greatest
saint in all the world?&nbsp; Well, it is not he who prays most or fasts
most; it is not he who gives most alms or is most eminent for temperance,
chastity, or justice.&nbsp; But it is he who is always thankful to God,
who wills everything that God willeth, who receives everything as an
instance of God&rsquo;s goodness, and has a heart always ready to praise
God for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps the shepherd&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; says
Thomas Scott, &ldquo;may refer to the obscure and quiet stations of
some pastors over small congregations, who live almost unknown to their
brethren, but are in a measure useful and very comfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps he does.&nbsp; And, whether he does or no, at any rate such
a song will suit some of our brethren very well as they go about among
their few and far-off flocks.&nbsp; They are not church leaders or popular
preachers.&nbsp; There is not much rattling with coaches or rumbling
with wheels at their church door.&nbsp; But, then, methinks, they have
their compensation.&nbsp; They are without much molestation.&nbsp; They
can be all the more thinking what they are, whence they came, and to
what their King has called them.&nbsp; Let them be happy in their shut-in
valleys.&nbsp; For I will dare to say that they wear more of that herb
called Heart&rsquo;s-ease in their bosom than those ministers do they
are sometimes tempted to emulate.&nbsp; I will add in this place that
to the men who live and trace these grounds the Lord hath left a yearly
revenue to be faithfully paid them at certain seasons for their maintenance
by the way, and for their further encouragement to go on in their pilgrimage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here little, and hereafter bliss,<br />
Is best from age to age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, now, from the shepherd boy and from his valley and his song,
let us go on without any more poetry or parable to look our own selves
full in the face and to ask our own hearts whether they are the hearts
of really humble-minded and New Testament men or no.&nbsp; Dr. Newman,
&ldquo;that subtle, devout man,&rdquo; as Dr. Duncan calls him, says
that &ldquo;humility is one of the most difficult of virtues both to
attain and to ascertain.&nbsp; It lies,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;close
upon the heart itself, and its tests are exceedingly delicate and subtle.&nbsp;
Its counterfeits abound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most true.&nbsp; And yet humility
is not intended for experts in morals only, or for men of a rare religious
genius only.&nbsp; The plainest of men, the least skilled and the most
unlettered of men, may not only excel in humility, but may also be permitted
to know that they are indeed planted, and are growing slowly but surely
in that grace of all graces.&nbsp; No doubt our Lord had, so to describe
it, the most delicate and the most subtle of human minds; and, no doubt
whatever, He had the most practised skill in reading off what lay closest
to His own heart.&nbsp; And, then, it was just His attainment of the
most perfect humility, and then His absolute ascertainment of the same,
that enabled Him to say: Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me.&nbsp;
At the same time, divine as the grace is, and divine as the insight
is that is able to trace it out in all its exquisite refinements of
thought and feeling in the sanctified soul, yet humility is a human
virtue after all, and it is open to all men to attain to it and intelligently
and lovingly to exercise it.&nbsp; The simplest and the least philosophical
soul now in this house may apply to himself some of the subtlest and
most sensitive tests of humility, as much as if he were Dr. Duncan or
Dr. Newman themselves; and may thus with all assurance of hope know
whether he is a counterfeit and a castaway or no.</p>
<p>Take this test for one, then.&nbsp; Explain this text to me: Phil.
ii. 3&mdash;&ldquo;In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better
than himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Explain and illustrate that.&nbsp; Not from
a commentary, but straight out from your own heart.&nbsp; What does
your heart make of that scripture?&nbsp; Does your heart turn away from
that scripture almost in anger at it?&nbsp; Do you say you are certain
that there must be some other explanation of it than that?&nbsp; Do
you hold that this is just another of Paul&rsquo;s perpetual hyperboles,
and that the New Testament is the last book in the world to be taken
as it reads?&nbsp; Yes; both bold and subtle father that he is: counterfeits
abound!</p>
<p>Another much blunter test, but, perhaps, a sufficiently sharp test,
is this: How do you receive correction and instruction?&nbsp; Does your
heart meekly and spontaneously and naturally take to correction and
instruction as the most natural and proper thing possible to you?&nbsp;
And do you immediately, and before all men, show forth and exhibit the
correction and the instruction?&nbsp; Or, does this rather take place?&nbsp;
Does your heart beat, and swell, and boil, and boil over at him who
dares to correct or counsel you?&nbsp; If this is a fair test to put
our humility to, how little humility there is among us!&nbsp; How few
men any of us could name among our friends to whom we would risk telling
all the things that behind their backs we point out continually to others?&nbsp;
We are terrified to face their pride.&nbsp; We once did it, and we are
not to do it again, if we can help it!&nbsp; Let a man not have too
many irons in the fire; let him examine himself just by these two tests
for the time&mdash;what he thinks of himself, and what he thinks of
those who attempt, and especially before other people, to set him right.&nbsp;
And after these two tests have been satisfied, others will no doubt
be supplied till that so humble man is made very humility itself.</p>
<p>And now, in the hope that there may be one or two men here who are
really and not counterfeitly in earnest to clothe themselves with humility
before God and man, let them take these two looms to themselves out
of which whole webs of such garments will be delivered to them every
day&mdash;their past life, and their present heart.&nbsp; With a past
life like ours, my brethren&mdash;and everyman knows his own&mdash;pride
is surely the maddest state of mind that any of us can allow ourselves
in.&nbsp; The first king of Bohemia kept his clouted old shoes ever
in his sight, that he might never forget that he had once been a ploughman.&nbsp;
And another wise king used to drink out of a coarse cup at table, and
excused himself to his guests that he had made the rude thing in his
rude potter days.&nbsp; Look with Primislaus and Agathocles at the hole
of the pit out of which you also have been dug; look often enough, deep
enough, and long enough, and you will be found passing up through the
Valley of Humiliation singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With us He dealt not as we sinn&rsquo;d,<br />
Nor did requite our ill!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another excellent use of the past is, if you are equal to it, to
call yourself aloud sometimes, or in writing, some of the names that
other people who know your past are certainly calling you.&nbsp; It
is a terrible discipline, but it is the terror of the Lord, and He will
not let it hurt you too much.&nbsp; I was before a blasphemer, and a
persecutor, and injurious, says Paul.&nbsp; And, to show Titus, his
gospel-son, the way, he said to him: We ourselves were sometimes foolish,
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.&nbsp; And John Bunyan
calls himself a blackguard, and many other worse names; only he swears
that neither with his soldiering nor with his tinkering hands did he
ever plash down Beelzebub&rsquo;s orchard.&nbsp; But if you have done
that, or anything like that, call yourself aloud by your true name on
your knees to-night.&nbsp; William Law testifies, after five-and-twenty
years&rsquo; experience of it, that he never heard of any harm that
he had done to any in his house by his habit of singing his secret psalms
aloud, and sometimes, ere ever he was aware, bursting out in his penitential
prayers.</p>
<p>And, then, how any man with a man&rsquo;s heart in his bosom for
a single day can escape being the chief of sinners, and consequently
the humblest of men for all the rest of his life on earth, passes my
comprehension!&nbsp; How a spark of pride can live in such a hell as
every human heart is would be past belief, did we not know that God
avenges sin by more sin; avenges Himself on a wicked and a false heart
by more wickedness and more falsehood, all ending in Satanic pride.</p>
<p>Too long as I have kept you in this valley to-night, I dare not let
you out of it till I have shared with you a few sentences on evangelical
humiliation out of that other so subtle and devout man, Jonathan Edwards.&nbsp;
But what special kind of humiliation is evangelical humiliation? you
will ask.&nbsp; Hear, then, what this master in Israel says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Evangelical
humiliation is the sense that a Christian man has of his own utter insufficiency,
utter despicableness, and utter odiousness; with an always answerable
frame of heart.&nbsp; This humiliation is peculiar to the true saints.&nbsp;
It arises from the special influence of the Spirit of God implanting
and exercising supernatural and divine principles; and it is accompanied
with a sense of the transcendent beauty of divine things.&nbsp; And,
thus, God&rsquo;s true saints all more or less see their own odiousness
on account of sin, and the exceedingly hateful nature of all sin.&nbsp;
The very essence of evangelical humiliation consists in such humility
as becomes a man in himself exceeding sinful but now under a dispensation
of grace.&nbsp; It consists in a mean esteem of himself, as in himself
nothing, and altogether contemptible and odious.&nbsp; This, indeed,
is the greatest and the most essential thing in true religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so on through a whole chapter of beaten gold.&nbsp; To which noble
chapter I shall only add that such teaching is as sweet, as strengthening,
and as reassuring to the truly Christian heart as it is bitter and hateful
to the counterfeit heart.</p>
<h2>OLD HONEST</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An honest heart.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
<p>Next tell them of Old Honest, who you found<br />
With his white hairs treading the pilgrim&rsquo;s ground;<br />
Yea, tell them how plain-hearted this man was,<br />
How after his good Lord he bare his cross:<br />
Perhaps with some grey head this may prevail,<br />
With Christ to fall in love, and sin bewail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would have said that no pilgrim to the Celestial City could possibly
have come from a worse place, or a more unlikely place, than was that
place from which Christian and Christiana and Matthew and Mercy had
come.&nbsp; And yet so it was.&nbsp; For Old Honest, this most excellent
and every way most delightful old saint, hailed from a far less likely
place than even the City of Destruction.&nbsp; For he came, this rare
old soul, of all places in the world, from the Town of Stupidity.&nbsp;
So he tells us himself.&nbsp; And, partly to explain to us the humiliating
name of his native town, and partly to exhibit himself as a wonder to
many, the frank old gentleman goes on to tell us that his birthplace
actually lies four degrees further away from the sun than does the far-enough
away City of Destruction itself.&nbsp; So that you see this grey-haired
saint is all that he always said he was&mdash;a living witness to the
fact that his Lord is able to save to the uttermost, and to gather in
His Father&rsquo;s elect from the utmost corner of the land.&nbsp; Men
are mountains of ice in my country, said Old Honest.&nbsp; I was one
of the biggest of those icebergs myself, he said.&nbsp; No man was ever
more cold and senseless to divine things than I was, and still sometimes
am.&nbsp; It takes the Sun of Righteousness all His might to melt the
men of my country.&nbsp; But that He can do it when He rises to do it,
and when He puts out His full strength to do it&mdash;Look at me! said
the genial old soul.</p>
<p>We have to construct this pilgrim&rsquo;s birth and boyhood and youth
from his after-character and conversation; and we have no difficulty
at all in doing that.&nbsp; For, if the child is the father of the man,
then the man must be the outcome of the child, and we can have no hesitation
in picturing to ourselves what kind of child and boy and young man dear
Old Honest must always have been.&nbsp; He never was a bright child,
bright and beaming old man as he is.&nbsp; He was always slow and heavy
at his lessons; indeed, I would not like to repeat to you all the bad
names that his schoolmasters sometimes in their impatience called the
stupid child.&nbsp; Only, this was to be said of him, that dulness of
uptake and disappointment of his teachers were the worst things about
this poor boy; he was not so ill-behaved as many were who were made
more of.&nbsp; When his wits began to waken up after he had come some
length he had no little leeway to make up in his learning; but that
was the chief drawback to Old Honest&rsquo;s pilgrimage.&nbsp; For one
thing, no young man had a cleaner record behind him than our Honest
had; his youthful garments were as unspotted as ever any pilgrim&rsquo;s
garments were.&nbsp; Even as a young man he had had the good sense to
keep company with one Good-conscience; and that friend of his youth
kept true to Old Honest all his days, and even lent him his hand and
helped him over the river at last.&nbsp; In his own manly, hearty, blunt,
breezy, cheery, and genial way Old Honest is a pilgrim we could ill
have spared.&nbsp; Old Honest has a warm place all for himself in every
good and honest heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, a little before the pilgrims stood an oak, and under
it when they came up to it they found an old pilgrim fast asleep; they
knew that he was a pilgrim by his clothes and his staff and his girdle.&nbsp;
So the guide, Mr. Greatheart, awaked him, and the old gentleman, as
he lifted up his eyes, cried out: What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Who
are you?&nbsp; And what is your business here?&nbsp; Come, man, said
the guide, be not so hot; here is none but friends!&nbsp; Yet the old
man gets up and stands upon his guard, and will know of them what they
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; That weather-beaten oak-tree under which we first
meet with Old Honest is an excellent emblem of the man.&nbsp; When he
sat down to rest his old bones that day he did not look out for a bank
of soft moss or for a bed of fragrant roses; that knotted oak-tree alone
had power to draw down under its sturdy trunk this heart of human oak.&nbsp;
It was a sight to see those thin grey haffets making a soft pillow of
that jutting knee of gnarled and knotty oak, and with his well-worn
quarterstaff held close in a hand all wrinkled skin and scraggy bone.&nbsp;
And from that day till he waved his quarterstaff when half over the
river and shouted, Grace reigns! there is no pilgrim of them all that
affords us half the good humour, sagacity, continual entertainment,
and brave encouragement we enjoy through this same old Christian gentleman.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, let us try to learn two or three lessons to-night from
Old Honest, his history, his character, and his conversation.&nbsp;
And, to begin with, let all those attend to Old Honest who are slow
in the uptake in the things of religion.&nbsp; O fools and slow of heart!
exclaimed our Lord at the two travellers to Emmaus.&nbsp; And this was
Old Honest to the letter when he first entered on the pilgrimage life;
he was slow as sloth itself in the things of the soul.&nbsp; I have
often wondered, said Greatheart, that any should come from your place;
for your town is worse than is the City of Destruction itself.&nbsp;
Yes, answered Honest, we lie more off from the sun, and so are more
cold and senseless.&nbsp; And his biographer here annotates on the margin
this reflection: &ldquo;Stupefied ones are worse than merely carnal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So they are; though it takes some insight to see that, and some courage
to carry that through.&nbsp; Now, to be downright stupid in a man&rsquo;s
natural intellects is sad enough, but to be stupid in the intellects
of the soul and of the spirit is far more sad.&nbsp; You will often
see this if you have any eyes in your head, and are not one of the stupid
people yourself.&nbsp; You will see very clever people in the intellects
of the head who are yet as stupid as the beasts in the stall in the
far nobler intellects of the heart.&nbsp; You will meet every day with
men and women who have received the best college education this city
can give them, who are yet stark stupid in everything that belongs to
true religion.&nbsp; They are quick to find out the inefficiency of
a university chair, or a schoolmaster&rsquo;s desk, but they know no
more of what a New Testament pulpit has been set up for than the stupidest
sot in the city.&nbsp; The Divine Nature, human nature, sin, grace,
redemption, salvation, holiness, heart-corruption, spiritual life, prayer,
communion with God, a conversation and a treasure in heaven,&mdash;to
all these noblest of studies and divinest of exercises they are as a
beast before God.&nbsp; When you come upon a man who is a sot in his
senses and in his understanding, you expect him to be the same in his
spiritual life.&nbsp; But to meet with an expert in science, a classical
scholar, an author or a critic in letters, a leader in political or
ecclesiastical or municipal life, and yet to discover that he is as
stupid as any sot in the things of his own soul, is one of the saddest
and most disheartening sights you can see.&nbsp; Much sadder and much
more disheartening than to see stairs and streets of people who can
neither read nor write.&nbsp; And yet our city is full of such stupid
people.&nbsp; You will find as utter spiritual stupidity among the rich
and the lettered and the refined of this city as you will find among
the ignorant and the vicious and the criminal classes.&nbsp; Is stupidity
a sin? asks Thomas in his Forty-Sixth Question.&nbsp; And the great
schoolman answers himself, &ldquo;Stupidity may come of natural incapacity,
in which case it is not a sin.&nbsp; But it may come, on the other hand,
of a man immersing his soul in the things of this world so as to shut
out all the things of God and of the world to come, in which case stupidity
is a deadly sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, from all that, you must already see
what you are to do in order to escape from your inborn and superinduced
stupidity.&nbsp; You are, like Old Honest, to open your gross, cold,
senseless heart to the Sun of Righteousness, and you are to take care
every day to walk abroad under His beams.&nbsp; You are to emigrate
south for your life, as our well-to-do invalids do, to where the sun
shines in his strength all the day.&nbsp; You are to choose such a minister,
buy and read such a literature, cultivate such an acquaintanceship,
and follow out such a new life of habits and practices as shall bring
you into the full sunshine, till your heart of ice is melted, and your
stupefied soul is filled with spiritual sensibility.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;were
a man a mountain of ice,&rdquo; said Old Honest, &ldquo;yet if the Sun
of Righteousness will arise upon him his frozen heart shall feel a thaw;
and thus hath it been with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your poets and your philosophers
have no resource against the stupidity that opposes them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even
the gods,&rdquo; they complain, &ldquo;fight unvictorious against stupidity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But your divines and your preachers have hope beside the dullest and
the stupidest and even the most imbruted.&nbsp; They point themselves
and their slowest and dullest-witted hearers to Old Honest, this rare
old saint; and they set up their pulpit with hope and boldness on the
very causeway of the town of Stupidity itself.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the second place,&mdash;on this fine old pilgrim&rsquo;s
birth and boyhood and youth.&nbsp; The apostle says that there is no
real difference between one of us and another; and what he says on that
subject must be true.&nbsp; No; there is really no difference compared
with the Celestial City whether a pilgrim is born in Stupidity, in Destruction,
in Vanity, or in Darkland.&nbsp; At the same time, nature, as well as
grace, is of God, and He maketh, when it pleaseth Him, one man to differ
in some most important respects from another.&nbsp; You see such differences
every day.&nbsp; Some children are naturally, and from their very infancy,
false and cruel, mean and greedy; while their brothers and sisters are
open and frank and generous.&nbsp; One son in a house is born a vulgar
snob, and one daughter a shallow-hearted and shameless little flirt;
while another brother is a born gentleman, and another sister a born
saint.&nbsp; Some children are tender-hearted, easily melted, and easily
moulded; while others in the same family are hard as stone and cold
as ice.&nbsp; Sometimes a noble and a truly Christian father will have
all his days to weep and pray over a son who is his shame; and then,
in the next generation, a grandson will be born to him who will more
than recover the lost image of his father&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; And
so is it sometimes with father Adam&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Here and there,
in Darkland, in Destruction, and in Stupidity, a child will be born
with a surprising likeness to the first Adam in his first estate.&nbsp;
That happy child at his best is but the relics and ruins of his first
father; at the same time, in him the relics are more abundant and the
ruins more easy to trace out.&nbsp; And little Honest was such a well-born
child.&nbsp; For, Stupidity and all, there was a real inborn and inbred
integrity, uprightness, straightforwardness, and nobleness about this
little and not over-clever man-child.&nbsp; And, on the principle of
&ldquo;to him that hath shall be given,&rdquo; there was something like
a special providence that hedged this boy about from the beginning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I girded thee though thou hast not known Me&rdquo; was never
out of Old Honest&rsquo;s mouth as often as he remembered the days of
his own youth and heard other pilgrims mourning over theirs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have surnamed thee though thou hast not known Me,&rdquo; he would say
to himself in his sleep.&nbsp; Slow-witted as he was, no one had been
able to cheat young Honest out of his youthful integrity.&nbsp; He had
not been led, and he had led no one else, into the paths of the destroyer.&nbsp;
He could say about himself all that John Bunyan so boldly and so bluntly
said about himself when his enemies charged him with youthful immorality.&nbsp;
He left the town in nobody&rsquo;s debt.&nbsp; He left the print of
his heels on no man or woman or child when he took his staff in his
hand to be a pilgrim.&nbsp; The upward walk of too many pilgrims is
less a walk than an escape and a flight.&nbsp; The avenger of men&rsquo;s
blood and women&rsquo;s honour has hunted many men deep into heaven&rsquo;s
innermost gate.&nbsp; But Old Honest took his time.&nbsp; He walked,
if ever pilgrim walked, all the way with an easy mind.&nbsp; He lay
down to sleep under the oaks on the wayside, and smiled like a child
in his sleep.&nbsp; And, when he was suddenly awaked, instead of crying
out for mercy and starting to his heels, he grasped his staff and demanded
even of an armed man what business he had to break in on an honest pilgrim&rsquo;s
midday repose!&nbsp; The King of the Celestial City had a few names
even in Stupidity which had not defiled their garments, and Old Honest
was one of them.&nbsp; And all his days his strength was as the strength
of ten, because his heart was pure.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; At the same time, honesty is not holiness; and no one knew
that better than did this honest old saint.&nbsp; When any one spoke
to Old Honest about his blameless youth, the look in his eye made them
keep at arm&rsquo;s-length as he growled out that without holiness no
man shall see God!&nbsp; Writing from Aberdeen to John Bell of Hentoun,
Samuel Rutherford says: &ldquo;I beseech you, in the Lord Jesus, to
mind your country above; and now, when old age is come upon you, advise
with Christ before you put your foot into the last ship and turn your
back on this life.&nbsp; Many are beguiled with this that they are free
of scandalous sins.&nbsp; But common honesty will not take men to heaven.&nbsp;
Alas! that men should think that ever they met with Christ who had never
a sick night or a sore heart for sin.&nbsp; I have known a man turn
a key in a door and lock it by.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; says
John Owen, &ldquo;and I do, commend moral virtues and honesty as much
as any man ought to do, and I am sure there is no grace where they are
not.&nbsp; Yet to make anything to be our holiness that is not derived
from Jesus Christ,&mdash;I know not what I do more abhor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are morally honest and sober men qualified for the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper?&rdquo; asks John Flavel.&nbsp; &ldquo;No; civility and morality
do not make a man a worthy communicant.&nbsp; They are not the wedding
garment; but regenerating grace and faith in the smallest measure are.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My outside may be honest,&rdquo; said this honest old pilgrim,
&ldquo;while all the time my heart is most unholy.&nbsp; My life is
open to all men, but I must hide my heart with Christ in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And then this racy-hearted old bachelor was as full of delight
in children, and in children&rsquo;s parties, with all their sweetmeats
and nuts and games and riddles,&mdash;quite as much so&mdash;as if he
had been their very grandfather himself.&nbsp; Nay, this rosy-hearted
old rogue was as inveterate a matchmaker as if he had been a mother
of the world with a houseful of daughters on her hands and with the
sons of the nobility dangling around.&nbsp; It would make you wish you
could kiss the two dear old souls, Gaius the innkeeper and Old Honest
his guest, if you would only read how they laid their grey heads together
to help forward the love-making of Matthew and Mercy.&nbsp; Yes, it
would be a great pity, said Old Honest,&mdash;thinking with a sigh of
his own childless old age,&mdash;it would be a great pity if this excellent
family of our sainted brother should fail for want of children, and
die out like mine.&nbsp; And the two old plotters went together to the
mother of the bridegroom, and told her with an aspect of authority that
she must put no obstacle in her son&rsquo;s way, but take Mercy as soon
as convenient into a closer relation to herself.&nbsp; And Gaius said
that he for his part would give the marriage supper.&nbsp; And I shall
make no will, said Honest, but hand all I have over to Matthew my son.&nbsp;
This is the way, said Old Honest; and he skipped and smiled and kissed
the cheek of the aged mother and said, Then thy two children shall preserve
thee and thy husband a posterity in the earth!&nbsp; Then he turned
to the boys and he said, Matthew, be thou like Matthew the publican,
not in vice, but in virtue.&nbsp; Samuel, he said, be thou like Samuel
the prophet, a man of faith and of prayer.&nbsp; Joseph, said he, be
thou like Joseph in Potiphar&rsquo;s house, chaste, and one that flees
from temptation.&nbsp; And James, be thou like James the Just, and like
James the brother of our Lord.&nbsp; Mercy, he said, is thy name, and
by mercy shalt thou be sustained and carried through all thy difficulties
that shall assault thee in the way, till thou shalt come thither where
thou shalt look the Fountain of Mercy in the face with comfort.&nbsp;
And all this while the guide, Mr. Greatheart, was very much pleased,
and smiled upon the nimble old gentleman.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it came to pass a while after that there was
a post in the town that inquired for Mr. Honest.&nbsp; So he came to
his house where he was, and delivered to his hands these lines, Thou
art commanded to be ready against this day seven night, to present thyself
before thy Lord at His Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; And for a token that
my message is true, all thy daughters of music shall be brought low.&nbsp;
Then Mr. Honest called for his friends and said unto them, I die, but
shall make no will.&nbsp; As for my honesty, it shall go with me: let
him that comes after me be told of this.&nbsp; When the day that he
was to be gone was come he addressed himself to go over the river.&nbsp;
Now, the river at that time overflowed the banks at some places.&nbsp;
But Mr. Honest in his lifetime had spoken to one Good-conscience to
meet him there, the which he also did, and lent him his hand, and so
helped him over.&nbsp; The last words of Mr. Honest were, Grace reigns!&nbsp;
So he left the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look at that picture and now look
at this: &ldquo;They then addressed themselves to the water, and, entering,
Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful,
he said, I sink in deep waves, the billows go over my head, all His
waters go over me.&nbsp; Then said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother,
I feel the bottom, and it is good.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Ah, my
friend, the sorrows of death have compassed me about; I shall not see
the land that flows with milk and honey.&nbsp; And with that a great
horror and darkness fell upon Christian, so that he could not see before
him; and all the words that he spoke still tended to discover that he
had horror of mind lest he should die in that river and never obtain
entrance in at the gate.&nbsp; Here also, as they that stood by perceived,
he was much in the troublesome thoughts of the sins that he had committed,
both since and before he began to be a pilgrim.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas also
observed that he was troubled with apparitions of hobgoblins and evil
spirits.&nbsp; Hopeful, therefore, had much ado to keep his brother&rsquo;s
head above water.&nbsp; Yea, sometimes he would be quite gone down,
and then ere a while he would rise up again half dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
My brethren, all my brethren, be not deceived; God is not mocked; for
whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.&nbsp; Whom the Lord
loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.&nbsp;
Thou, O God, wast a God that forgavest them, but Thou tookest vengeance
on their inventions.</p>
<h2>MR. FEARING</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Happy is the man that feareth alway.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Solomon</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For humour, for pathos, for tenderness, for acute and sympathetic
insight at once into nature and grace, for absolutely artless literary
skill, and for the sweetest, most musical, and most exquisite English,
show me another passage in our whole literature to compare with John
Bunyan&rsquo;s portrait of Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; You cannot do it.&nbsp;
I defy you to do it.&nbsp; Spenser, who, like John Bunyan, wrote an
elaborate allegory, says: It is not in me.&nbsp; Take all Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s
features together, and even Shakespeare himself has no such heart-touching
and heart-comforting character.&nbsp; Addison may have some of the humour
and Lamb some of the tenderness; but, then, they have not the religion.&nbsp;
Scott has the insight into nature, but he has no eye at all for grace;
while Thackeray, who, in some respects, comes nearest to John Bunyan
of them all, would be the foremost to confess that he is not worthy
to touch the shoe-latchet of the Bedford tinker.&nbsp; As Dr. Duncan
said in his class one day when telling us to read Augustine&rsquo;s
Autobiography and Halyburton&rsquo;s:&mdash;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;be prepared for this, that the tinker beats them all!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; says Browning, &ldquo;in this God speaks, no
tinker hath such powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as they walked along together, the guide asked the old gentleman
if he knew one Mr. Fearing that came on pilgrimage out of his parts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Honest, &ldquo;very well.&nbsp; He was a
man that had the root of the matter in him; but he was one of the most
troublesome pilgrims that ever I met with in all my days.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I perceive you knew him,&rdquo; said the guide, &ldquo;for you
have given a very right character of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Knew him!&rdquo;
exclaimed Honest, &ldquo;I was a great companion of his; I was with
him most an end.&nbsp; When he first began to think of what would come
upon us hereafter, I was with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I was his
guide,&rdquo; said Greatheart, &ldquo;from my Master&rsquo;s house to
the gates of the Celestial City.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said
Mr. Honest, &ldquo;it seems he was well at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
yes,&rdquo; answered the guide, &ldquo;I never had any doubt about him;
he was a man of a choice spirit, only he was always kept very low, and
that made his life so burdensome to himself and so troublesome to others.&nbsp;
He was, above many, tender of sin; he was so afraid of doing injuries
to others that he would often deny himself of that which was lawful
because he would not offend.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; asked
Honest, &ldquo;should be the reason that such a good man should be all
his days so much in the dark?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are two sorts
of reasons for it,&rdquo; said the guide; &ldquo;one is, the wise God
will have it so: some must pipe and some must weep.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Fearing
was one that played upon this base.&nbsp; He and his fellows sound the
sackbut, whose notes are more doleful than the notes of other music
are.&nbsp; Though, indeed, some say that the base is the ground of music.&nbsp;
And, for my part, I care not at all for that profession that begins
not with heaviness of mind.&nbsp; The first string that the musician
usually touches is the base when he intends to put all in tune.&nbsp;
God also plays upon this string first when He sets the soul in tune
for Himself.&nbsp; Only, here was the imperfection of Mr. Fearing, that
he could play upon no other music but this till toward his latter end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Take Mr. Fearing, then, to begin with, at the Slough of
Despond.&nbsp; Christian and Pliable, they being heedless, did both
fall into that bog.&nbsp; But Mr. Fearing, whatever faults you may think
he had&mdash;and faults, too, that you think you could mend in him&mdash;at
any rate, he was never heedless.&nbsp; Everybody has his fault to find
with poor Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; Everybody blames poor Mr. Fearing.&nbsp;
Everybody can improve upon poor Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; But I will say again
for Mr. Fearing that he was never heedless.&nbsp; Had Peter been on
the road at that period he would have stood up for Mr. Fearing, and
would have taken his judges and would have said to them, with some scorn&mdash;Go
to, and pass the time of your sojourning here with something of the
same silence and the same fear!&nbsp; Christian&rsquo;s excuse for falling
into the Slough was that fear so followed him that he fled the next
way, and so fell in.&nbsp; But Mr. Fearing had no such fear behind him
in his city as Christian had in his.&nbsp; All Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s fears
were within himself.&nbsp; If you can take up the distinction between
actual and indwelling sin, between guilt and corruption, you have already
in that the whole key to Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; He was blamed and counselled
and corrected and pitied and patronised by every morning-cloud and early-dew
neophyte, while all the time he lived far down from the strife of tongues
where the root of the matter strikes its deep roots still deeper every
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;It took him a whole month,&rdquo; tells Greatheart,
&ldquo;to face the Slough.&nbsp; But he would not go back neither.&nbsp;
Till, one sunshiny morning, nobody ever knew how, he ventured, and so
got over.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is,&rdquo; said the shrewd-headed
guide, &ldquo;Mr. Fearing had, I think, a slough of despond in his own
mind; and a slough that he carried everywhere with him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes, that was it.&nbsp; Greatheart in that has hit the nail on the head.&nbsp;
With one happy stroke he has given us the whole secret of poor Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s
life-long trouble.&nbsp; Just so; it was the slough in himself that
so kept poor Mr. Fearing back.&nbsp; This poor pilgrim, who had so little
to fear in his past life, had yet so much scum and filth, spume and
mire in his present heart, that how to get on the other side of that
cost him not a month&rsquo;s roaring only, but all the months and all
the years till he went over the River not much above wet-shod.&nbsp;
And, till then, not twenty million cart-loads of wholesome instructions,
nor any number of good and substantial steps, would lift poor Mr. Fearing
over the ditch that ran so deep and so foul continually within himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, he had, I think, a slough of despond in his mind, a slough
that he carried everywhere with him, or else he never could have been
the man he was.&rdquo;&nbsp; I, for one, thank the great-hearted guide
for that fine sentence.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It was a sight to see poor Mr. Fearing at the wicket gate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He read
the inscription over the gate a thousand times, but every time he read
it his slough-filled heart said to him, Yes, but that is not for such
as you.&nbsp; Pilgrim after pilgrim came up the way, read the writing,
knocked, and was taken in; but still Mr. Fearing stood back, shaking
and shrinking.&nbsp; At last he ventured to take hold of the hammer
that hung on the gate and gave with it a small rap such as a mouse might
make.&nbsp; But small as the sound was, the Gatekeeper had had his eye
on his man all the time out of his watch-window; and before Mr. Fearing
had time to turn and run, Goodwill had him by the collar.&nbsp; But
that sudden assault only made Mr. Fearing sink to the earth, faint and
half-dead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace be to thee, O trembling man!&rdquo; said
Goodwill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in, and welcome!&rdquo;&nbsp; When he did
venture in, Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s face was as white as a sheet.&nbsp;
You would have said that an officer had caught a thief if you had seen
poor Mr. Fearing hiding his face, and the Gatekeeper hauling him in.&nbsp;
And not all the entertainment for which the Gate was famous, nor all
the encouragement that Goodwill was able to speak, could make terrified
Mr. Fearing for once to smile.&nbsp; A more hard-to-entertain pilgrim,
all the Gate declared when he had gone, they had never had in their
hospitable house.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;So he came,&rdquo; said the guide, &ldquo;till he
came to our House; but as he behaved himself at the Gate, so he did
at my Master the Interpreter&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He lay about in the
cold a good while before he would adventure to call.&nbsp; Yet he would
not go back neither.&nbsp; And the nights were cold and long then.&nbsp;
At last I think I looked out of the window, and perceiving a man to
be up and down about the door, I went out to him, and asked what he
was; but, poor man, the water stood in his eyes.&nbsp; So I perceived
what he wanted.&nbsp; I went in, therefore, and told it in the house,
and we showed the thing to our Lord.&nbsp; So He sent me out again to
entreat him to come in, but I dare say I had hard work to do it.&nbsp;
At last he came in, and I will say that for my Lord, He carried it wonderful
lovingly to Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; There were but a few good bits at the
table, but some of it was laid upon his trencher.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this
way the guide tells us his first introduction to Mr. Fearing, and how
Mr. Fearing behaved himself in the Interpreter&rsquo;s House.&nbsp;
For instance, in the parlour full of dust, when the Interpreter said
that the dust is original sin and inward corruption, you would have
thought that the Interpreter had stabbed poor Mr. Fearing to the heart,
so did he break out and weep.&nbsp; Before the damsel could come with
the pitcher, Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s eyes alone would have laid the dust,
they were such a fountain of tears.&nbsp; When he saw Passion and Patience,
each one in his chair&mdash;&ldquo;I am that child in rags,&rdquo; said
Mr. Fearing; &ldquo;I have already received all my good things!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Also, at the wall where the fire burned because oil was poured into
it from the other side, he perversely turned that fire also against
himself.&nbsp; And when they came to the man in the iron cage, you could
not have told whether the miserable man inside the cage or the miserable
man outside of it sighed the loudest.&nbsp; And so on, through all the
significant rooms.&nbsp; The spider-room overwhelmed him altogether,
till his sobs and the beating of his breast were heard all over the
house.&nbsp; The robin also when gobbling up spiders he made an emblem
of himself, and the tree that was rotten at the heart,&mdash;till the
Interpreter&rsquo;s patience with this so perverse pilgrim was fairly
worn out.&nbsp; So the Interpreter shut up his significant rooms, and
had this so troublesome pilgrim into his own chamber, and there carried
it so tenderly to Mr. Fearing that at last he did seem to have taken
some little heart of grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then we,&rdquo; said Greatheart,
&ldquo;set forward, and I went before him; but the man was of few words,
only he would often sigh aloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dumpish at the House Beautiful&rdquo; is his biographer&rsquo;s
not very respectful comment on the margin of the history.&nbsp; There
were too many merry-hearted damsels running up and down that house for
Mr. Fearing.&nbsp; He could not lift his eyes but one of those too-tripping
maidens was looking at him.&nbsp; He could not stir a foot but he suddenly
ran against a talking and laughing bevy of them.&nbsp; There was one
thing he loved above everything, and that was to overhear the talk that
went on at that season in that house about the City above, and about
the King of that City, and about His wonderful ways with pilgrims, and
the entertainment they all got who entered that City.&nbsp; But to get
a word out of Mr. Fearing upon any of these subjects,&mdash;all the
king&rsquo;s horses could not have dragged it out of him.&nbsp; Only,
the screen was always seen to move during such conversations, till it
soon came to be known to all the house who was behind the screen.&nbsp;
And the talkers only talked a little louder as the screen moved, and
took up, with a smile to one another, another and a yet more comforting
topic.</p>
<p>The Rarity Rooms also were more to Mr. Fearing than his necessary
food.&nbsp; He would be up in the morning and waiting at the doors of
those rooms before the keepers had come with their keys.&nbsp; And they
had to tell him that the candles were to be put out at night before
he would go away.&nbsp; He was always reading, as if he had never read
it before, the pedigree of the Lord of the Hill.&nbsp; Moses&rsquo;
rod, Shamgar&rsquo;s goad, David&rsquo;s sling and stone, and what not&mdash;he
laughed and danced and sang like a child around these ancient tables.&nbsp;
The armoury-room also held him, where were the swords, and shields,
and helmets, and breast-plates, and shoes that would not wear out.&nbsp;
You would have thought you had your man all right as long as you had
him alone among these old relics; but, let supper be ready, and the
house gathered, and Mr. Fearing was as dumpish as ever.&nbsp; Eat he
would not, drink he would not, nor would he sit at the same table with
those who ate and drank with such gladness.&nbsp; I remembered Mr. Fearing
at the House Beautiful when I was present at a communion season some
time back in Ross-shire.&nbsp; The church was half full of Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s
close kindred that communion morning.&nbsp; For, all that the minister
himself could do, and all that the assisting minister could do&mdash;no!
to the table those self-examined, self-condemned, fear-filled souls
would not come.&nbsp; The two ministers, like Mr. Greatheart&rsquo;s
Master, carried it wonderful lovingly with those poor saints that day;
but those who are in deed, and not in name only, passing the time of
their sojourning here in fear&mdash;they cannot all at once be lifted
above all their fears, even by the ablest action sermons, or by the
most wise and tender table-addresses.&nbsp; And, truth to tell, though
you will rebuke me all the way home to-night for saying it, my heart
sat somewhat nearer to those old people who were perhaps a little too
dumpish in their repentance and their faith and their hope that morning,
than it did to those who took to the table with a light heart.&nbsp;
I know all your flippant cant about gospel liberty and against Highland
introspection, as you call it&mdash;as well as all your habitual neglect
of a close and deep self-examination, as Paul called it; but I tell
you all to-night that it would be the salvation of your soul if you
too worked your way up to every returning Lord&rsquo;s table with much
more fear and much more trembling.&nbsp; Let a man examine himself,
Saxon as well as Celt, in Edinburgh as well as in Ross-shire, and so
let him eat of that flesh and drink of that blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;These
pills,&rdquo; said Mr. Skill, &ldquo;are to be taken three at a time
fasting in half a quarter of a pint of the tears of repentance; these
pills are good to prevent diseases, as well as to cure when one is sick.&nbsp;
Yea, I dare say it, and stand to it, that if a man will but use this
physic as he should, it will make him live for ever.&nbsp; But thou
must give these pills no other way but as I have prescribed; for, if
you do, they will do no good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then he and I set
forward,&rdquo; said the guide, &ldquo;and I went before; but my man
was of but few words, only he would often sigh aloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; As to the Hill Difficulty, that was no stick at all to Mr.
Fearing; and as for the lions, he pulled their whiskers and snapped
his fingers in their dumfoundered faces.&nbsp; For you must know that
Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s trouble was not about such things as these at all;
his only fear was about his acceptance at last.&nbsp; He beat Mr. Greatheart
himself at getting down into the Valley of Humiliation, till the guide
was fain to confess that he went down as well as he ever saw man go
down in all his life.&nbsp; This pilgrim cared not how mean he was,
so he might be but happy at last.&nbsp; That is the reason why so many
of God&rsquo;s best saints take so kindly and so quietly to things that
drive other men mad.&nbsp; You wonder sometimes when you see an innocent
man sit down quietly under accusations and insults and injuries that
you spend all the rest of your life resenting and repaying.&nbsp; And
that is the reason also that so many of God&rsquo;s best saints in other
ages and other communions used to pursue evangelical humility and ascetic
poverty and seclusion till they obliterated themselves out of all human
remembrance, and buried themselves in retreats of silence and of prayer.&nbsp;
Yes, you are quite right.&nbsp; A garment of sackcloth may cover an
unsanctified heart; and the fathers of the desert did not all escape
the depths of Satan and the plague of their own heart.&nbsp; Quite true.&nbsp;
A contrite heart may be carried about an applauding city in a coach
and six; and a crucified heart may be clothed in purple and fine linen,
and may fare sumptuously every day.&nbsp; A saint of God will sometimes
sit on a throne with a more weaned mind than that with which Elijah
or the Baptist will macerate themselves in the wilderness.&nbsp; Every
man who is really set on heaven must find his own way thither; and he
who is really intent on his own way thither will neither have the time
nor the heart to throw stones at his brother who thinks he has discovered
his own best way.&nbsp; All the pilgrims who got to the City at last
did not get down Difficulty and through Humiliation so well as Mr. Fearing
did; nor was it absolutely necessary that they should.&nbsp; It was
not to lay down an iron-fast rule for others, but it was only to amuse
the way with his account of Mr. Fearing, that the guide went on to say:
&ldquo;Yes, I think there was a kind of sympathy betwixt that valley
and my man.&nbsp; For I never saw him better in all his pilgrimage than
when he was in that valley.&nbsp; For here he would lie down, embrace
the ground, and kiss the very flowers that grew in this valley.&nbsp;
He would now be up every morning by break of day, tracing and walking
to and fro in that valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Now, do you think you could guess how Mr. Fearing conducted
himself in Vanity Fair?&nbsp; Your guess is important to us and to you
to-night; for it will show whether or no John Bunyan and Mr. Greatheart
have spent their strength for nought and in vain on you.&nbsp; It will
show whether or no you have got inside of Mr. Fearing with all that
has been said; and thus, inside of yourself.&nbsp; Guess, then.&nbsp;
How did Mr. Fearing do in Vanity Fair, do you think?&nbsp; To give you
a clue, recollect that he was the timidest of souls.&nbsp; And remember
how you have often been afraid to look at things in a shop window lest
the shopkeeper should come out and hold you to the thing you were looking
at.&nbsp; Remember also that you are the life-long owners of some things
just because they were thrown at your head.&nbsp; Remember how you sauntered
into a sale on one occasion, and, out of sheer idleness and pure fun,
made a bid, and to your consternation the encumbrance was knocked down
to your name; and it fills up your house to-day till you would give
ten times its value to some one to take it away for ever out of your
sight.&nbsp; Well, what was it that those who were so shamelessly and
so pesteringly cadging about places, and titles, and preferments, and
wives, and gold, and silver, and such like&mdash;what was it they prevailed
on this poor stupid countryman to cheapen and buy?&nbsp; Do you guess,
or do you give it up?&nbsp; Well, Greatheart himself was again and again
almost taken in; and would have been had not Mr. Fearing been beside
him.&nbsp; But Mr. Fearing looked at all the jugglers, and cheats, and
knaves, and apes, and fools as if he would have bitten a firebrand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought he would have fought with all the men of the fair;
I feared there we should have both been knock&rsquo;d o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
head, so hot was he against their fooleries.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then&mdash;for
Greatheart was a bit of a philosopher, and liked to entertain and while
the away with tracing things up to their causes&mdash;&ldquo;it was
all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because Mr. Fearing was so tender of sin.&nbsp;
He was above many tender of sin.&nbsp; He was so afraid, not for himself
only, but of doing injury to others, that he would deny himself the
purchase and possession and enjoyment even of that which was lawful,
because he would not offend.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All this while,&rdquo;
says Bunyan himself, in the eighty-second paragraph of <i>Grace Abounding</i>,
&ldquo;as to the act of sinning I was never more tender than now.&nbsp;
I durst not take a pin or a stick, though but so big as a straw, for
my conscience now was sore and would smart at every touch.&nbsp; I could
not now tell how to speak my words for fear I should misplace them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The highest flames,&rdquo; says Jeremy Taylor in his <i>Life
of Christ</i>, &ldquo;are the most tremulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when he was come at the river where was no bridge,
there, again, Mr. Fearing was in a heavy case.&nbsp; Now, he said, he
should be drowned for ever, and so never see that Face with comfort
that he had come so many miles to behold.&nbsp; And here also I took
notice of what was very remarkable; the water of that river was lower
at this time than ever I saw it in all my life, so he went over at last
not much above wet-shod.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Christiana, &ldquo;This
relation of Mr. Fearing has done me good.&nbsp; I thought nobody had
been like me, but I see there was some semblance betwixt this good man
and I, only we differed in two things.&nbsp; His troubles were so great
that they broke out, but mine I kept within.&nbsp; His also lay so hard
upon him that he could not knock at the houses provided for entertainment,
but my trouble was always such that it made me knock the louder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I might also speak my heart,&rdquo; said Mercy, &ldquo;I must
say that something of him has also dwelt in me.&nbsp; For I have ever
been more afraid of the lake, and the loss of a place in Paradise, than
I have been of the loss of other things.&nbsp; Oh! thought I, may I
have the happiness to have a habitation there: &rsquo;tis enough though
I part with all the world to win it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Matthew,
&ldquo;Fear was one thing that made me think that I was far from having
that within me that accompanies salvation; but if it was so with such
a good man as he, why may it not also go well with me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No fears, no grace,&rdquo; said James.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though there
is not always grace where there is fear of hell; yet, to be sure, there
is no grace where there is no fear of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
said, James,&rdquo; said Greatheart; &ldquo;thou hast hit the mark,
for the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; and, to be sure, they
that want the beginning have neither middle nor end.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
we shall here conclude our discourse of Mr. Fearing after we have sent
after him this farewell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It is because<br />
Then thou didst fear, that now thou dost not fear.<br />
Thou hast forestalled the agony, and so<br />
For thee the bitterness of death is past.<br />
Also, because already in thy soul<br />
The judgment is begun.&nbsp; That day of doom,<br />
One and the same for this collected world&mdash;<br />
That solemn consummation for all flesh,<br />
Is, in the case of each, anticipate<br />
Upon his death; and, as the last great day<br />
In the particular judgment is rehearsed,<br />
So now, too, ere thou comest to the Throne,<br />
A presage falls upon thee, as a ray<br />
Straight from the Judge, expressive of thy lot.<br />
That calm and joy uprising in thy soul<br />
Is first-fruit to thy recompense,<br />
And heaven begun.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>FEEBLE-MIND</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Comfort the feeble-minded.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeble-mind shall first tell you his own story in his own words,
and then I shall perhaps venture a few observations upon his history
and his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am but a sickly man, as you see,&rdquo; said Feeble-mind
to Greatheart, &ldquo;and because Death did usually knock once a day
at my door, I thought I should never be well at home.&nbsp; So I betook
myself to a pilgrim&rsquo;s life, and have travelled hither from the
town of Uncertain, where I and my father were born.&nbsp; I am a man
of no strength at all of body, nor yet of mind; but would, if I could,
though I can but crawl, spend my life in the pilgrim&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;
When I came at the gate that is at the head of the way, the Lord of
that place did entertain me freely.&nbsp; Neither objected he against
my weakly looks, nor against my feeble mind; but gave me such things
as were necessary for my journey, and bade me hope to the end.&nbsp;
When I came to the house of the Interpreter I received much kindness
there; and, because the Hill Difficulty was judged too hard for me,
I was carried up that hill by one of his servants.&nbsp; Indeed I have
found much relief from pilgrims, though none were willing to go so softly
as I am forced to do.&nbsp; Yet, still, as they came on, they bid me
be of good cheer, and said that it was the will of their Lord that comfort
should be given to the feeble-minded, and so went on their own pace.&nbsp;
I look for brunts by the way; but this I have resolved on, to wit, to
run when I can, to go when I cannot run, and to creep when I cannot
go.&nbsp; As to the main, I thank Him that loves me, I am fixed.&nbsp;
My way is before me, my mind is beyond the river that has no bridge,
though I am, as you see, but of a feeble mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said old Mr. Honest, &ldquo;Have you not some time ago been
acquainted with one Mr. Fearing, a pilgrim?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Acquainted
with him! yes.&nbsp; He came from the town of Stupidity, which lies
four degrees to the northward of the City of Destruction, and as many
off where I was born.&nbsp; Yet we were well acquainted; for, indeed,
he was mine uncle, my father&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; He and I have been
much of a temper; he was a little shorter than I, but yet we were much
of a complexion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I perceive that you know him,&rdquo;
said Mr. Honest, &ldquo;and I am apt to believe also that you were related
one to another; for you have his whitely look, a cast like his with
your eye, and your speech is much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Feeble-mind went on, &ldquo;I want a suitable
companion.&nbsp; You are all lusty and strong, but I, as you see, am
weak.&nbsp; I choose therefore rather to come behind, lest, by reason
of my many infirmities, I should be both a burden to myself and to you.&nbsp;
I am, as I said, a man of a weak and feeble mind, and shall be offended
and made weak at that which others can bear.&nbsp; I shall like no laughing;
I shall like no gay attire; I shall like no unprofitable questions.&nbsp;
Nay, I am so weak a man as to be offended with what others have a liberty
to do.&nbsp; I do not yet know all the truth.&nbsp; I am a very ignorant
Christian man.&nbsp; Sometimes, if I hear some rejoice in the Lord,
it troubles me because I cannot do so too.&nbsp; It is with me as with
a weak man among the strong, or as with a sickly man among the healthy,
or as a lamp despised.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But, brother,&rdquo; said
Greatheart, &ldquo;I have it in commission to comfort the feeble-minded
and to support the weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus therefore, they went on&mdash;Mr.
Greatheart and Mr. Honest went before; Christiana and her children went
next; and Mr. Feeble-mind and Mr. Ready-to-halt came behind with his
crutches.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, a single word as to Feeble-mind&rsquo;s
family tree.</p>
<p>Thackeray says that <i>The Peerage</i> is the Family Bible of every
true-born Englishman.&nbsp; Every genuine Englishman, he tells us, teaches
that sacred book diligently to his children.&nbsp; He talks out of it
to them when he sits in the house and when he walks by the way.&nbsp;
He binds it upon his children&rsquo;s hands, and it is as a frontlet
between their eyes.&nbsp; He writes its names upon the doorposts of
his house, and makes pictures out of it upon his gates.&nbsp; Now, John
Bunyan was a born Englishman in his liking for a family tree.&nbsp;
He had no such tree himself&mdash;scarcely so much as a bramble bush;
but, all the same, let the tinker take his pen in hand, and the pedigrees
and genealogies of all his pilgrims are sure to be set forth as much
as if they were to form the certificates that those pilgrims were to
hand in at the gate.</p>
<p>Feeble-mind, then, was of an old, a well-rooted and a wide-spread
race.&nbsp; The county of Indecision was full of that ancient stock.&nbsp;
They had intermarried in-and-in also till their small stature, their
whitely look, the droop of their eye, and their weak leaky speech all
made them to be easily recognised wherever they went.&nbsp; It was Feeble-mind&rsquo;s
salvation that Death had knocked at his door every day from his youth
up.&nbsp; He was feeble in body as well as in mind; only the feebleness
of his body had put a certain strength into his mind; the only strength
he ever showed, indeed, was the strength that had its roots in a weak
constitution at which sickness and death struck their dissolving blows
every day.&nbsp; To escape death, both the first and the second death,
any man with a particle of strength left would run with all his might;
and Feeble-mind had strength enough somewhere among his weak joints
to make him say, &ldquo;But this I have resolved on, to wit, to run
when I can, to go when I cannot run, and to creep when I cannot go.&nbsp;
As to the main, I am fixed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; At the Wicket Gate pilgrim Feeble-mind met with nothing
but the kindest and the most condescending entertainment.&nbsp; It was
the gatekeepers way to become all things to all men.&nbsp; The gatekeeper&rsquo;s
nature was all in his name; for he was all Goodwill together.&nbsp;
No kind of pilgrim ever came wrong to Goodwill.&nbsp; He never found
fault with any.&nbsp; Only let them knock and come in and he will see
to all the rest.&nbsp; The way is full of all the gatekeeper&rsquo;s
kind words and still kinder actions.&nbsp; Every several pilgrim has
his wager with all the rest that no one ever got such kindness at the
gate as he got.&nbsp; And even Feeble-mind gave the gatekeeper this
praise&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord of the place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did
entertain me freely.&nbsp; Neither objected he against my weakly looks
nor against my feeble mind.&nbsp; But he gave me such things as were
necessary for my journey, and bade me hope to the end.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All things considered, that is perhaps the best praise that Goodwill
and his house ever earned.&nbsp; For, to receive and to secure Feeble-mind
as a pilgrim&mdash;to make it impossible for Feeble-mind to entertain
a scruple or a suspicion that was not removed beforehand&mdash;to make
it impossible for Feeble-mind to find in all the house and in all its
grounds so much as a straw over which he could stumble&mdash;that was
extraordinary attention, kindness, and condescension in Goodwill and
all his good-willed house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on, go on, dear Mr. Feeble
mind,&rdquo; said Goodwill giving his hand to Mr. Fearing&rsquo;s nephew,
&ldquo;go on: keep your feeble mind open to the truth, and still hope
to the end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to the Interpreter&rsquo;s House, I received much
kindness there.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; But in that short speech
I think there must he hid no little shame and remorse.&nbsp; No words
could possibly be a severer condemnation of Feeble-mind than his own
two or three so irrelevant words about the Interpreter&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
No doubt at all, Feeble-mind received kindness there; but that is not
the point.&nbsp; That noble house was not built at such cost, and fitted
up, and kept open all the year round, and filled with fresh furniture
from year to year, merely that those who passed through its significant
rooms might report that they had received no rudeness at the hands of
the Interpreter.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the Interpreter
to Feeble-mind, &lsquo;and I will show thee what will be profitable
to thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he commanded his man to light the candle and
bid Feeble-mind follow him.&nbsp; But it was all to no use.&nbsp; Feeble-mind
had neither the taste nor the capacity for the significant rooms.&nbsp;
Nay, as one after another of those rich rooms was opened to him, Feeble-mind
took a positive dislike to them.&nbsp; Nothing interested him; nothing
instructed him.&nbsp; But many things stumbled and angered him.&nbsp;
The parlour full of dust, and how the dust was raised and laid; Passion
and Patience; the man in the iron cage; the spider-room; the muck-rake
room; the robin with its red breast and its pretty note, and yet with
its coarse food; the tree, green outside but rotten at the heart,&mdash;all
the thanks the Interpreter took that day for all that from Feeble-mind
was in such speeches as these: You make me lose my head.&nbsp; I do
not know where I am.&nbsp; I did not leave the town of Uncertain to
be confused and perplexed in my mind with sights and sounds like these.&nbsp;
Let me out at the door I came in at, and I shall go back to the gate.&nbsp;
Goodwill had none of these unhappy rooms in his sweet house!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nothing could exceed the kindness of the Interpreter himself; but his
house was full of annoyances and offences and obstructions to Mr. Feeble-mind.&nbsp;
He did not like the Interpreter&rsquo;s house, and he got out of it
as fast as he could, with his mind as feeble as when he entered it;
and, what was worse, with his temper not a little ruffled.</p>
<p>And we see this very same intellectual laziness, this very same downright
dislike at divine truth, in our own people every day.&nbsp; There are
in every congregation people who take up their lodgings at the gate
and refuse to go one step farther on the way.&nbsp; A visit to the Interpreter&rsquo;s
House always upsets them.&nbsp; It turns their empty head.&nbsp; They
do not know where they are.&nbsp; They will not give what mind they
have to divine truth, all you can do to draw them on to it, till they
die as feeble-minded, as ignorant, and as inexperienced as they were
born.&nbsp; They never read a religious book that has any brain or heart
in it.&nbsp; The feeble <i>Lives</i> of feeble-minded Christians, written
by feeble-minded authors, and published by feeble-minded publishers,&mdash;we
all know the spoon-meat that multitudes of our people go down to their
second childhood upon.&nbsp; Jonathan Edwards&mdash;a name they never
hear at home, but one of the most masculine and seraphic of interpreters&mdash;has
a noble discourse on The Importance and Advantage of a thorough Knowledge
of Divine Truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consider yourselves,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as
scholars or disciples put into the school of Christ, and therefore be
diligent to make proficiency in Christian knowledge.&nbsp; Content not
yourselves with this, that you have been taught your Catechism in your
childhood, and that you know as much of the principles of religion as
is necessary to salvation.&nbsp; Let not your teachers have cause to
complain that while they spend and are spent to impart knowledge to
you, you take little pains to learn.&nbsp; Be assiduous in reading the
Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; And when you read, observe what you read.&nbsp;
Observe how things come in.&nbsp; Compare one scripture with another.&nbsp;
Procure and diligently use other books which may help you to grow in
this knowledge.&nbsp; There are many excellent books extant which might
greatly forward you in this knowledge.&nbsp; There is a great defect
in many, that through a lothness to be at a little expense, they provide
themselves with no more helps of this nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Weighty,
wise, and lamentably true words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mundanus,&rdquo; says William Law, &ldquo;is a man of excellent
parts, and clear apprehension.&nbsp; He is well advanced in age, and
has made a great figure in business.&nbsp; He has aimed at the greatest
perfection in everything.&nbsp; The only thing which has not fallen
under his improvement, nor received any benefit from his judicious mind,
is his devotion; this is just in the same poor state it was when he
was six years of age, and the old man prays now in that little form
of words which his mother used to hear him repeat night and morning.&nbsp;
This Mundanus that hardly ever saw the poorest utensil without considering
how it might be made or used to better advantage, has gone on all his
life long praying in the same manner as when he was a child; without
ever considering how much better or oftener he might pray; without considering
how improvable the spirit of devotion is, how many helps a wise and
reasonable man may call to his assistance, and how necessary it is that
our prayers should be enlarged, varied, and suited to the particular
state and condition of our lives.&nbsp; How poor and pitiable is the
conduct of this man of sense, who has so much judgment and understanding
in everything but that which is the whole wisdom of man!&rdquo;&nbsp;
How true to every syllable is that!&nbsp; How simple-looking, and yet
how manly, and able, and noble!&nbsp; We close our young men&rsquo;s
session with Law and Butler to-night, and I cannot believe that our
session with those two giants has left one feeble mind in the two classes;
they were all weeded out after the first fortnight of the session; though,
after all is done, there are still plenty left both among old and young
in the congregation.&nbsp; Even Homer sometimes nods; and I cannot but
think that John Bunyan has made a slip in saying that Feeble-mind enjoyed
the Interpreter&rsquo;s House.&nbsp; At any rate, I wish I could say
as much about all the feeble minds known to me.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Hill Difficulty, which might have helped to make a man
of Feeble-mind, saw a laughable, if it had not been such a lamentable,
spectacle.&nbsp; For it saw this poor creature hanging as limp as wet
linen on the back of one of the Interpreter&rsquo;s sweating servants.&nbsp;
Your little boy will explain the parable to you.&nbsp; Shall I do this?
or, shall I rather do that? asks Feeble-mind at every stop.&nbsp; Would
it be right? or, would it be wrong?&nbsp; Shall I read that book?&nbsp;
Shall I go to that ball?&nbsp; Shall I marry that man?&nbsp; Tell me
what to do.&nbsp; Give me your hand.&nbsp; Take me up upon your back,
and carry me over this difficult hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was carried up
that,&rdquo; says poor Feeble-mind, &ldquo;by one of his servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &ldquo;The one calamity of Mr. Feeble-mind&rsquo;s history,&rdquo;
says our ablest commentator on Bunyan, &ldquo;was the finest mercy of
his history.&rdquo;&nbsp; That one calamity was his falling into Giant
Slay-good&rsquo;s hands, and his finest mercy was his rescue by Greatheart,
and his consequent companionship with his deliverer, with Mr. Honest,
and with Christiana and her party till they came to the river.&nbsp;
You constantly see the same thing in the life of the Church and of the
Christian Family.&nbsp; Some calamity throws a weak, ignorant, and immoral
creature into close contact with a minister or an elder or a Christian
visitor, who not only relieves him from his present distress, but continues
to keep his eye upon his new acquaintance, introduces him to wise and
good friends, invites him to his house, gives him books to read, and
keeps him under good influences, till, of a weak, feeble, and sometimes
vicious character, he is made a Christian man, till he is able for himself
to say, It was good for me to be afflicted; the one calamity of my history
has been my best mercy!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Feeble-mind, I am ashamed to have to admit, behaved himself
in a perfectly scandalous manner at the house of Gaius mine host.&nbsp;
He went beyond all bounds during those eventful weeks.&nbsp; Those weeks
were one long temptation to Feeble-mind&mdash;and he went down in a
pitiful way before his temptation.&nbsp; Two marriages and two honeymoons,
with suppers and dances every night, made the old hostelry like very
Pandemonium itself to poor Feeble-mind.&nbsp; He would have had Matthew&rsquo;s
and James&rsquo;s marriages conducted next door to a funeral.&nbsp;
Because he would not eat flesh himself, he protested against Gaius killing
a sheep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said old Honest, almost laying his
quarterstaff over Feeble-mind&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;Man, dost
thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and
ale?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall like no laughing,&rdquo; said Feeble-mind;
&ldquo;I shall like no gay attire; I shall like no unprofitable questions.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I think it took some self-conceit to refuse to sit at table beside Christiana
because of her gay attire.&nbsp; And I hope Mercy did not give up dressing
well, even after she was married, to please that weak-minded old churl.&nbsp;
And as to unprofitable questions&mdash;we are all tempted to think that
question unprofitable which our incapacity or our ignorance keeps us
silent upon at table.&nbsp; We think that topic both ill-timed and impertinent
and unsafe to which we are not invited to contribute anything.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a very ignorant man,&rdquo; he went on to say; and, if that
was said in any humility, Feeble-mind never said a truer word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is with me as it is with a weak man among the strong, or as
with a sick man among the healthy, or as a lamp despised in the thought
of him that is at ease.&rdquo;&nbsp; All which only brought Greatheart
out in his very best colours.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, brother,&rdquo; said
the guide, &ldquo;I have it in commission to comfort the feeble-minded,
and to support the weak.&nbsp; You must needs go along with us; we will
wait for you, we will lend you our help, we will deny ourselves of some
things, both opinionative and practical, for your sake; we will not
enter into doubtful disputations before you; we will be made all things
to you rather than that you shall be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The first thing that did Mr. Feeble-mind any real good was
his being made military guard over the women and the children while
the men went out to demolish Doubting Castle.&nbsp; <i>Quis custodiet</i>?
you will smile and say when you hear that.&nbsp; Who shall protect the
protector? you will say.&nbsp; But wait a little.&nbsp; Greatheart knew
his business.&nbsp; For not only did Feeble-mind rise to the occasion,
when he was put to it; but, more than that, he was the soul of good
company at supper-time that night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jocund and merry&rdquo;
are the very words.&nbsp; Yes; give your feeble and fault-finding folk
something to do.&nbsp; Send them to teach a class.&nbsp; Send them down
into a mission district.&nbsp; Lay a sense of responsibility upon them.&nbsp;
Leave them to deal with this and that emergency themselves.&nbsp; Cease
carrying them on your back, and lay weak and evil and self-willed people
on their back.&nbsp; Let them feel that they are of some real use.&nbsp;
As Matthew Arnold says, Let the critic but try practice, and you will
make a new man of him.&nbsp; As Greatheart made of Feeble-mind by making
him mount guard over the Celestial caravan while the fighting men were
all up at Doubting Castle.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mark this,&rdquo; says Mr. Feeble-mind&rsquo;s biographer
on the early margin of his history, lest we should be tempted to forget
the good parts of this troublesome and provoking pilgrim&mdash;&ldquo;Mark
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, namely, which Feeble-mind says to his guide.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As to the main, I thank Him that loves me, I am fixed.&nbsp;
My way is before me, my mind is beyond the river that has no bridge,
though I am, as you see, but of a feeble mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that
leads us with returning regard and love to turn to the end of his history,
where we read: &ldquo;After this Mr. Feeble-mind had tidings brought
him that the post sounded his horn at his chamber door.&nbsp; Then he
came in and told him, saying, I am come to tell thee that thy Master
hath need of thee, and that in very little time thou must behold His
face in brightness.&nbsp; Then Mr. Feeble-mind called for his friends,
and told them what errand had been brought to him, and what token he
had received of the truth of the message.&nbsp; As for my feeble mind
he said, that I shall leave behind me, for I shall have no need of that
in the place whither I go.&nbsp; Nor is it worth bestowing upon the
poorest pilgrim.&nbsp; Wherefore, when I am gone, I desire that you
would bury it in a dung-hill.&nbsp; This done, and the day being come
in which he was about to depart, he entered the river as the rest.&nbsp;
His last words were, Hold out, faith and patience!&nbsp; So he went
over to the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>GREAT-HEART</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;when thou shalt enlarge my heart.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Sabbath, the 12th December 1886, I heard the late Canon Liddon
preach a sermon in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, in which he classed Oliver
Cromwell with Alexander the Sixth and with Richard the Third.&nbsp;
I had taken my estimate of the great Protector&rsquo;s character largely
from Carlyle&rsquo;s famous book, and you can judge with what feelings
I heard the canon&rsquo;s comparison.&nbsp; And, besides, I had been
wont to think of the Protector as having entered largely into John Bunyan&rsquo;s
portrait of Greatheart, the pilgrim guide.&nbsp; And the researches
and the judgments of Dr. Gardiner have only gone to convince me, the
eloquent canon notwithstanding, that Bunyan could not have chosen a
better contemporary groundwork for his Greatheart than just the great
Puritan soldier.&nbsp; Cromwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;mental struggles before
his conversion,&rdquo; his life-long &ldquo;searchings of heart,&rdquo;
his &ldquo;utter absence of vindictiveness,&rdquo; his unequalled capacity
for &ldquo;seeing into the heart of a situation,&rdquo; and his own
&ldquo;all-embracing hospitality of heart&rdquo;&mdash;all have gone
to reassure me that my first guess as to Bunyan&rsquo;s employment of
the Protector&rsquo;s matchless personality and services had not been
so far astray.&nbsp; And the oftener I read the noble history of Greatheart,
the better I seem to hear, beating behind his fine figure, by far the
greatest heart that ever ruled over the realm of England.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first time that we catch a glimpse of Greatheart&rsquo;s
weather-beaten and sword-seamed face is when he is taking a stolen look
out of the window at Mr. Fearing, who is conducting himself more like
a chicken than a man around the Interpreter&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; And
from that moment till Mr. Fearing shouted &ldquo;Grace reigns!&rdquo;
as he cleared the last river, never sportsman surely stalked a startled
deer so patiently and so skilfully and so successfully as Greatheart
circumvented that chicken-hearted pilgrim.&nbsp; &ldquo;At last I looked
out of the window, and perceiving a man to be up and down about the
door, I went out to him and asked him what he was; but, poor man, the
water stood ill his eyes.&nbsp; So I perceived what he wanted.&nbsp;
I went in, therefore, and told it in the house, and we showed the thing
to our Lord.&nbsp; So He sent me out again to entreat him to come in;
but I dare say I had hard work to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Greatheart&rsquo;s
whole account of Mr. Fearing always brings the water to my eyes also.&nbsp;
It is indeed a delicious piece of English prose.&nbsp; If I were a professor
of <i>belles lettres</i> instead of what I am, I would compel all my
students, under pain of rustication, to get those three or four classical
pages by heart till they could neither perpetrate nor tolerate bad English
any more.&nbsp; This camp-fire tale, told by an old soldier, about a
troublesome young recruit and all his adventures, touches, surely, the
high-water mark of sweet and undefiled English.&nbsp; Greatheart was
not the first soldier who could handle both the sword and the pen, and
he has not been the last.&nbsp; But not C&aelig;sar and not Napier themselves
ever handled those two instruments better.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Greatheart had just returned to his Master&rsquo;s house
from having seen Mr. Fearing safely through all his troubles and well
over the river, when, behold, another caravan of pilgrims is ready for
his convoy.&nbsp; For Greatheart, you must know, was the Interpreter&rsquo;s
armed servant.&nbsp; When at any time Greatheart was off duty, which
in those days was but seldom, he took up his quarters again in the Interpreter&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; As he says himself, he came back from the river-side only
to look out of the Interpreter&rsquo;s window to see if there was any
more work on the way for him to do.&nbsp; And, as good luck would have
it, as has been said, the guide was just come back from his adventures
with Mr. Fearing when a pilgrim party, than which he had never seen
one more to his mind, was introduced to him by his Master, the Interpreter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Interpreter,&rdquo; so we read at this point, &ldquo;then
called for a man-servant of his, one Greatheart, and bid him take sword,
and helmet, and shield, and take these, my daughters,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and conduct them to the house called Beautiful, at which place
they will rest next.&nbsp; So he took his weapons and went before them,
and the Interpreter said, God-speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Now I saw in my dream that they went on, and Greatheart
went before them, so they came to the place where Christian&rsquo;s
burden fell off his back and tumbled into a sepulchre.&nbsp; Here, then,
they made a pause, and here also they blessed God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
said Christiana, &ldquo;it comes to my mind what was said to us at the
gate; to wit, that we should have pardon by word and by deed.&nbsp;
What it is to have pardon by deed, Mr. Greatheart, I suppose you know;
wherefore, if you please, let us hear your discourse thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;So then, to speak to the question,&rdquo; said Greatheart.&nbsp;
You have all heard about the &ldquo;question-day&rdquo; at Highland
communions.&nbsp; That day is so called because questions that have
arisen in the minds of &ldquo;the men&rdquo; in connection with doctrine
and with experience are on that day set forth, debated out, and solved
by much meditation and prayer; age, saintliness, doctrinal and experimental
reading, and personal experience all making their contribution to the
solution of the question in hand.&nbsp; Just such a question, then,
and handled in such a manner, was that question which whiled the way
and cheated the toil till the pilgrims came to the House Beautiful.&nbsp;
The great doctrinal and experimental Puritans, with Hooker at their
head, put forth their full strength and laid out their finest work just
on this same question that Christiana gave out at the place, somewhat
ascending, upon which stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom,
a sepulchre.&nbsp; But not the great Comment on The Galatians itself,
next to the Holy Bible as it is, as most fit for a wounded conscience;
no, nor that perfect mass of purest gold, The Learned Discourse of Justification,
nor anything else of that kind known to me, is for one moment, to compare
in beauty, in tenderness, in eloquence, in scriptural depth, and in
scriptural simplicity with Greatheart&rsquo;s noble resolution of Christiana&rsquo;s
question which he made on the way from the Interpreter&rsquo;s house
to the House Beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is brave!&rdquo; exclaimed
that mother in Israel, when the guide had come to an end.&nbsp; &ldquo;Methinks
it makes my heart to bleed to think that He should bleed for me.&nbsp;
O Thou loving One!&nbsp; O Thou blessed One!&nbsp; Thou deservest to
have me, for Thou hast bought me.&nbsp; No marvel that this made the
water to stand in my husband&rsquo;s eyes, and that it made him trudge
so nimbly on.&nbsp; O Mercy, that thy father and thy mother were here;
yea, and Mrs. Timorous too!&nbsp; Nay, I wish now with all my heart
that here was Madam Wanton too.&nbsp; Surely, surely their hearts would
be affected here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Promise me to read at home Greatheart&rsquo;s
discourse on the Righteousness of Christ, and you will thank me for
having exacted the promise.</p>
<p>The incongruity of a soldier handling such questions, and especially
in such a style, has stumbled some of John Bunyan&rsquo;s fault-finding
readers.&nbsp; The same incongruity stumbled &ldquo;the Honourable Colonel
Hacker, at Peebles or elsewhere,&rdquo; to whom Cromwell sent these
from Edinburgh on the 25th December 1650&mdash;&ldquo;But indeed I was
not satisfied with your last speech to me about Empson, that he was
a better preacher than fighter or soldier&mdash;or words to that effect.&nbsp;
Truly, I think that he that prays and preaches best will fight best.&nbsp;
I know nothing that will give like courage and confidence as the knowledge
of God in Christ will; and I bless God to see any in this army able
and willing to impart the knowledge they have for the good of others.&nbsp;
I pray you receive Captain Empson lovingly: I dare assure you he is
a good man and a good officer; I would we had no worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you not go in and stay till morning?&rdquo;
said the porter to Greatheart, at the gate of the House Beautiful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the guide; &ldquo;I will return to my lord to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;O sir!&rdquo; cried Christiana and Mercy, &ldquo;we know not
how to be willing you should leave us in our pilgrimage.&nbsp; Oh that
we might have your company till our journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then said James, the youngest of the boys, &ldquo;Pray be persuaded
to go with us and help us, because we are so weak and the way so dangerous
as it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am at my lord&rsquo;s commandment,&rdquo;
said Greatheart.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he shall allow me to be your guide
quite through, I shall willingly wait upon you.&nbsp; But here you failed
at first; for when he bid me come thus far with you, then you should
have begged me of him to have gone quite through with you, and he would
have granted your request.&nbsp; However, at present, I must withdraw,
and so, good Christiana, Mercy, and my brave children, adieu!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Help lost for want of asking for,&rdquo; is our author&rsquo;s
condemnatory comment on the margin at this point in the history.&nbsp;
And there is not a single page in my history, or in yours, my brethren,
on which the same marginal lament is not written.&nbsp; What help we
would have had on our Lord&rsquo;s promise if we had but taken the trouble
to ask for it!&nbsp; And what help we once had, and have now lost, just
because when we had it we did not ask for a continuance of it!&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Greatheart to the porter, and to the two women,
and to James&mdash;&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I will return to my lord to-night.&nbsp;
I am at my lord&rsquo;s commandment; only, if he shall still allot me
I shall willingly wait upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, what with the House Beautiful, so full of the most delightful
company; what with music in the house and music in the heart; what with
Mr. Brisk&rsquo;s courtship of Mercy, Matthew&rsquo;s illness, Mr. Skill&rsquo;s
cure of the sick man, and what not&mdash;a whole month passed by like
a day in that so happy house.&nbsp; But at last Christiana and Mercy
signified it to those of the house that it was time for them to be up
and going.&nbsp; Then said Joseph to his mother, &ldquo;It is convenient
that you send back to the house of Mr. Interpreter to pray him to grant
that Mr. Greatheart should be sent to us that he may be our conductor
the rest of our way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;I had almost forgot.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she drew up a petition and
prayed Mr. Watchful the porter to send it by some fit man to her good
friend, Mr. Interpreter; who, when it was come and he had seen the contents
of the petition, said to the messenger, &ldquo;Go, tell them that I
will send him.&rdquo; . . . Now, about this time one knocked at the
door.&nbsp; So the porter opened, and, behold, Mr. Greatheart was there!&nbsp;
But when he came in, what joy was there!&nbsp; Then said Mr. Greatheart
to the two women, &ldquo;My lord has sent each of you a bottle of wine,
and also some parched corn, together with a couple of pomegranates.&nbsp;
He has also sent the boys some figs and raisins to refresh you on your
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The weak may sometimes call the strong to prayers,&rdquo;
I read again in the margin opposite the mention of Joseph&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;
Not that I am strong, and not that she is weak, but one of my people
I spent an hour with last afternoon whom you would to a certainty have
called weak had you seen her and her surrounding,&mdash;she so called
me to prayer that I had to hurry home and go straight to it.&nbsp; And
all last night and all this morning I have had as many pomegranates
as I could eat and as much wine as I could drink.&nbsp; Yes; you attend
to what the weakest will sometimes say to you, and they will often put
you on the way to get Greatheart back again with a load of wines and
fruits and corn on his shoulder to refresh you on your journey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; said Christiana to Joseph her youngest son,
&ldquo;Good boy!&nbsp; I had almost forgot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; When old Mr. Honest began to nod after the good supper that
Gaius mine host gave to the pilgrims, &ldquo;What, sir,&rdquo; cried
Greatheart, &ldquo;you begin to be drowsy; come, rub up; now here&rsquo;s
a riddle for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Mr. Honest, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
hear it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Mr. Greatheart,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that will kill, must first be overcome;<br />
Who live abroad would, first must die at home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said Mr. Honest, &ldquo;it is a hard one; hard
to expound, and harder still to practise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; this after-supper
riddle of Mr. Greatheart is a hard one in both respects; and for this
reason, because the learned and much experienced guide&mdash;learned
with all that his life-long quarters in the Interpreter&rsquo;s House
could teach him, and experienced with a lifetime&rsquo;s accumulated
experience of the pilgrim life&mdash;has put all his learning and all
his life into these two mysterious lines.&nbsp; But old Honest, once
he had sufficiently rubbed up his eyes and his intellects, gave the
answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He first by grace must conquered be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sin would mortify.<br />
And who, that lives, would convince me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto himself must die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly; shrewd old Honest; you have hit off both Greatheart and
his riddle too.&nbsp; You have dived into the deepest heart of the Interpreter&rsquo;s
man-servant.&nbsp; &ldquo;The magnanimous man&rdquo; was Aristotle&rsquo;s
masterpiece.&nbsp; That great teacher of mind and morals created for
the Greek world their Greatheart.&nbsp; But, &ldquo;thou must understand,&rdquo;
says Bunyan to his readers, &ldquo;that I never went to school to Aristotle
or Plato.&nbsp; No; but to Paul, who taught Bunyan that what Aristotle
calls magnanimity is really pride&mdash;taught him that, till there
is far more of the Christian religion in those two doggerel lines at
Gaius&rsquo;s supper-table than there is in all The Ethics taken together.&nbsp;
And it is only from a personal experience of the same life as that which
the guide puts here into his riddle that any man&rsquo;s proud heart
will become really humble and thus really great, really enlarged, and
of an all-embracing hospitality like Cromwell&rsquo;s and Greatheart&rsquo;s
and John Bunyan&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; Would you, then, become a Greatheart
too?&nbsp; And would you be employed in your day as they were employed
in their day?&nbsp; Then expound to yourself, and practise, and follow
out that deep riddle with which Greatheart so woke up old Honest:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that will kill, must first be overcome;<br />
Who live abroad would, first must die at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.&nbsp; Greatheart again and again at the river-side, Greatheart
sending pilgrim after pilgrim over the river with rapture, and he himself
still summoned to turn his back on the Celestial City, and to retrace
his steps through the land of Beulah, through the Valley of the Shadow
of Death, and through the Valley of Humiliation, and back to the Interpreter&rsquo;s
house to take on another and another and another convoy of fresh pilgrims,
and his own abundant entrance still put off and never to come,&mdash;our
hearts bleed for poor Greatheart.&nbsp; Back and forward, back and forward,
year after year, this noble soul uncomplainingly goes.&nbsp; And, ever
as he waves his hand to another pilgrim entering with trumpets within
the gates, he salutes his next pilgrim charge with the brave words:
&ldquo;Yet what I shall choose I wot not.&nbsp; For I am in a strait
betwixt two: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ.&nbsp;
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you, for your
furtherance and joy of faith by my coming to you again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If Greatheart could not &ldquo;usher himself out of this life&rdquo;
along with Christiana, and Mercy, and Mr. Honest, and Standfast, and
Valiant-for-truth&mdash;if he had still to toil back and bleed his way
up again at the head of another happy band of pilgrims&mdash;well, after
all is said, what had the Celestial City itself to give to Greatheart
better than such blessed work?&nbsp; With every such returning journey
he got a more and more enlarged, detached, hospitable, and Christ-like
heart, and the King&rsquo;s palace in very glory itself had nothing
better in store for this soldier-guide than that.&nbsp; A nobler heaven
Greatheart could not taste than he had already in himself, as he championed
another and another pilgrim company from his Master&rsquo;s earthly
gate to his Master&rsquo;s heavenly gate.&nbsp; Like Paul, his apostolic
prototype, Greatheart sometimes vacillated just for a moment when he
came a little too near heaven, and felt its magnificent and almost dissolving
attractions full in his soul.&nbsp; You will see Greatheart&rsquo;s
mind staggering for a moment between rest and labour, between war and
peace, between &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; on earth and &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;
in heaven&mdash;you will see all that set forth with great sympathy
and great ability in Principal Rainy&rsquo;s new book on Paul&rsquo;s
Epistle to the Philippians, and in the chapter entitled, The Apostle&rsquo;s
Choice between Living and Dying.</p>
<p>Then there came a summons for Mr. Standfast.&nbsp; At which he called
to him Mr. Greatheart, and said unto him, &ldquo;Sir, although it was
not my hap to be much in your good company in the days of my pilgrimage,
yet, since the time I knew you, you have been profitable to me.&nbsp;
When I came from home I left behind me a wife and five small children.&nbsp;
Let me entreat you, at your return (for I know that you will go and
return to your master&rsquo;s house in hopes that you may be a conductor
to more of the holy pilgrims), that you send to my family and let them
be acquainted with all that hath and shall happen to me.&nbsp; Tell
them, moreover, of my happy arrival to this place, and of the present
late blessed condition I am in, and so on for many other messages and
charges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Standfast; very good.&nbsp; But I would
have liked you on your deathbed much better if you had had a word to
spare from yourself and your wife and your children for poor Greatheart
himself, who had neither wife nor children, nor near hope of heaven,
but only your trust and charge and many suchlike trusts and charges
to carry out when you are at home and free of all trust and all charge
and all care.&nbsp; But yours is the way of all the pilgrims&mdash;so
long, at least, as they are in this selfish life.&nbsp; Let them and
their children only be well looked after, and they have not many thoughts
or many words left for those who sweat and bleed to death for them and
theirs.&nbsp; They lean on this and that Greatheart all their own way
up, and then they leave their widows and children to lean on whatever
Greatheart is sent to meet them; but it is not one pilgrim in ten who
takes the thought or has the heart to send a message to Mr. Greatheart
himself for his own consolation and support.&nbsp; I read that Mr. Ready-to-halt
alone, good soul, had the good feeling to do it.&nbsp; He thanked Mr.
Greatheart for his conduct and for his kindness, and so addressed himself
to his journey.&nbsp; All the same, noble Greatheart! go on in thy magnanimous
work.&nbsp; Take back all their errands.&nbsp; Seek out at any trouble
all their wives and children.&nbsp; Embark again and again on all thy
former battles and hardships for the good of other men.&nbsp; But be
assured that all this thy labour is not in vain in thy Lord.&nbsp; Be
well assured that not one drop of thy blood or thy sweat or thy tears
shall fall to the ground on that day when they that be wise shall shine
as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness
as the stars for ever and ever.&nbsp; Go back, then, from thy well-earned
rest, O brave Greatheart! go back to thy waiting task.&nbsp; Put on
again thy whole armour.&nbsp; Receive again, and again fulfil, thy Master&rsquo;s
commission, till He has no more commissions left for thy brave heart
and thy bold hand to execute.&nbsp; And, one glorious day, while thou
art still returning to thy task, it shall suddenly sound in thy dutiful
ears:&mdash;&ldquo;Well done! good and faithful servant!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then thou too</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shalt hang thy trumpet in the hall<br />
And study war no more.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MR. READY-TO-HALT</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For I am ready to halt.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ready-to-halt is the Mephibosheth of the pilgrimage.&nbsp; While
Mephibosheth was still a child in arms, his nurse let the young prince
fall, and from that day to the day of his death he was lame in both
his feet.&nbsp; Mephibosheth&rsquo;s life-long lameness, and then David&rsquo;s
extraordinary grace to the disinherited cripple in commanding him to
eat continually at the king&rsquo;s table; in those two points we have
all that we know about Mr. Ready-to-halt also.&nbsp; We have no proper
portrait, as we say, of Mr. Ready-to-halt.&nbsp; Mr. Ready-to-halt is
but a name on John Bunyan&rsquo;s pages&mdash;a name set upon two crutches;
but, then, his simple name is so suggestive and his two crutches are
so eloquent, that I feel as if we might venture to take this life-long
lameter and his so serviceable crutches for our character-lecture to-night.</p>
<p>John Bunyan, who could so easily and so delightfully have done it,
has given us no information at all about Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s early
days.&nbsp; For once his English passion for a pedigree has not compelled
our author&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp; We would have liked immensely to have
been told the name, and to have seen displayed the whole family tree
of young Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s father; and, especially, of his mother.&nbsp;
Who was his nurse also?&nbsp; And did she ever forgive herself for the
terrible injury she had done her young master?&nbsp; What were his occupations
and amusements as a little cripple boy?&nbsp; Who made him his first
crutch?&nbsp; Of what wood was it made?&nbsp; And at what age, and under
whose kind and tender directions did he begin to use it?&nbsp; And,
then, with such an infirmity, what ever put it into Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s
head to attempt the pilgrimage?&nbsp; For the pilgrimage was a task
and a toil that took all the limbs and all the lungs and all the labours
and all the endurances that the strongest and the bravest of men could
bring to bear upon it.&nbsp; How did this complete cripple ever get
through the Slough, and first up and then down the Hill Difficulty,
and past all the lions, and over a thousand other obstacles and stumbling-blocks,
till he arrived at mine host&rsquo;s so hospitable door?&nbsp; The first
surprised sight we get of this so handicapped pilgrim is when Greatheart
and Feeble-mind are in the heat of their discourse at the hostelry door.&nbsp;
At that moment Mr. Ready-to-halt came by with his crutches in his hand,
and he also was going on pilgrimage.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, they went
on.&nbsp; Mr. Greatheart and Mr. Honest went on before, Christiana and
her children went next, and Mr. Feeble-mind and Mr. Ready-to-halt came
behind with his crutches.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Put by the curtains, look within my veil,<br />
Turn up my metaphors, and do not fail,<br />
There, if thou seekest them, such things to find,<br />
As will be helpful to an honest mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, when we put by the curtains and turn up the
metaphors, what do we find?&nbsp; What, but just this, that poor Mr.
Ready-to-halt was, after all, the greatest and the best believer, as
the New Testament would have called him, in all the pilgrimage.&nbsp;
We have not found so great faith as that of Mr. Ready-to-halt, no, not
in the very best of the pilgrim bands.&nbsp; Each several pilgrim had,
no doubt, his own good qualities; but, at pure and downright believing&mdash;at
taking God at His bare and simple word&mdash;Mr. Ready-to-halt beat
them all.&nbsp; All that flashes in upon us from one shining word that
stands on the margin of our so metaphorical author.&nbsp; This single
word, the &ldquo;promises,&rdquo; hangs like a key of gold beside the
first mention of Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s crutches&mdash;a key such
that in a moment it throws open the whole of Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s
otherwise lockfast and secret and inexplicable life.&nbsp; There it
all is, as plain as a pike-staff now!&nbsp; Yes; Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s
crutches are just the divine promises.&nbsp; I wonder I did not see
that all the time.&nbsp; Why, I could compose all his past life myself
now.&nbsp; I have his father and his mother and his nurse at my finger-ends
now.&nbsp; This poor pilgrim&mdash;unless it would be impertinence to
call him poor any more&mdash;had no limbs to be called limbs.&nbsp;
Such limbs as he had were only an encumbrance to this unique pedestrian.&nbsp;
All the limbs he had were in his crutches.&nbsp; He had not one atom
of strength to lean upon apart from his crutches.&nbsp; A bone, a muscle,
a tendon, a sinew, may be ill-nourished, undeveloped, green, and unknit,
but, at the worst, they are inside of a man and they are his own.&nbsp;
But a crutch, of however good wood it may be made, and however good
a lame man may be at using it&mdash;still, a crutch at its best is but
an outside additament; it is not really and originally a part of a man&rsquo;s
very self at all.&nbsp; And yet a lame man is not himself without his
crutch.&nbsp; Other men do not need to give a moment&rsquo;s forethought
when they wish to rise up to walk, or to run, or to leap, or to dance.&nbsp;
But the lame man has to wait till his crutches are brought to him; and
then, after slowly and painfully hoisting himself up upon his crutches,
with great labour, he at last takes the road.&nbsp; Mr. Ready-to-halt,
then, is a man of God; but he is one of those men of God who have no
godliness within themselves.&nbsp; He has no inward graces.&nbsp; He
has no past experiences.&nbsp; He has no attainments that he can for
one safe moment take his stand upon, or even partly lean upon.&nbsp;
Mr. Ready-to-halt is absolutely and always dependent upon the promises.&nbsp;
The promises of God in Holy Scripture are this man&rsquo;s very life.&nbsp;
All his religion stands in the promises.&nbsp; Take away the promises,
and Mr. Ready-to-halt is a heap of heaving rags on the roadside.&nbsp;
He cannot take a single step unless upon a promise.&nbsp; But, at the
same time, give Mr. Ready-to-halt a promise in his hand and he will
wade the Slough upon it, and scale up and slide down the Hill Difficulty
upon it, and fight a lion, and even brain Beelzebub with it, till he
will with a grudge and a doubt exchange it even for the chariots and
the horses that wait him at the river.&nbsp; What a delight our Lord
would have taken in Mr. Ready-to-halt had He come across him on His
way to the passover!&nbsp; How He would have given Mr. Ready-to-halt
His arm; how He would have made Himself late by walking with him, and
would still have waited for him!&nbsp; Nay, had that been a day of chap-books
in carpenters&rsquo; shops and on the village stalls, how He would have
had Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s story by heart had any brass-worker in
Galilee told the history!&nbsp; Our Lord was within an inch of telling
that story Himself, when He showed Thomas His hands and His side.&nbsp;
And at another time and in another place we might well have had Mr.
Ready-to-halt as one more of our Lord&rsquo;s parables for the common
people.&nbsp; Only, He left the delight and the reward of drawing out
this parable to one He already saw and dearly loved in a far-off island
of the sea, the Puritan tinker of Evangelical England.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And now, after all that, would you think it going too far
if I were to say that in making Himself like unto all His brethren,
our Lord made Himself like Mr. Ready-to-halt too?&nbsp; Indeed He did.&nbsp;
And it was because his Lord did this, that Mr. Ready-to-halt so loved
his Lord as to follow Him upon crutches.&nbsp; It would not be thought
seemly, perhaps, to carry the figure too close to our Lord.&nbsp; But,
figure apart, it is only orthodox and scriptural to say that our Lord
accomplished His pilgrimage and finished His work leaning all along
upon His Father&rsquo;s promises.&nbsp; Esaias is very bold about this
also, for he tells his readers again and again that their Messiah, when
He comes, will have to be held up.&nbsp; He will have to be encouraged,
comforted, and carried through by Jehovah.&nbsp; And in one remarkable
passage he lets us see Jehovah hooping Messiah&rsquo;s staff first with
brass, and then with silver, and then with gold.&nbsp; Let Thomas Goodwin&rsquo;s
genius set the heavenly scene full before us.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
it dialoguewise set forth,&rdquo; says that great preacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;First
Christ shows His commission, telling God how He had called Him and fitted
Him for the work of redemption, and He would know what reward He should
receive of Him for so great an undertaking.&nbsp; God at first offers
low; only the elect of Israel.&nbsp; Christ thinks these too few, and
not worth so great a labour and work, because few of the Jews would
come in; and therefore He says that He would labour in vain if this
were all His recompense; and yet withal He tells God that seeing His
heart is so much set on saving sinners, to satisfy Him, He will do it
even for those few.&nbsp; Upon this God comes off more freely, and openeth
His heart more largely to Him, as meaning more amply to content Him
for His pains in dying.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a light thing,&rsquo; says
God to Him, &lsquo;that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the
tribes of Jacob&mdash;that is not worth Thy dying for.&nbsp; I value
Thy sufferings more than so.&nbsp; I will give Thee for a salvation
to the ends of the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon this He made a promise to
Christ, a promise which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world
began.&nbsp; God cannot lie, and, most of all, not to His Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, then, more even than that.&nbsp; This same deep divine tells
us that it is a certain rule in divinity that, whatsoever we receive
from Christ, that He Himself first receives in Himself for us.&nbsp;
All the promises of God&rsquo;s word are made and fulfilled to Christ
first, and so to us in and after Him.&nbsp; In other words, our Lord&rsquo;s
life was so planned for Him in heaven and was so followed out and fulfilled
by Him on earth, that, to take up the metaphor again, He actually tried
every crutch and every staff with His own hands and with His own armpits;
He actually leaned again and again His own whole weight upon every several
one of them.&nbsp; Every single promise, the most unlikely for Him to
lean upon and to plead, yet, be sure of it, He somehow made experiment
upon them all, and made sure that there was sufficient and serviceable
grace within and under every one of them.&nbsp; So that, Mr. Ready-to-halt,
there is no possible staff you can take into your hand that has not
already been in the hand of your Lord.&nbsp; Think of that, O Mr. Ready-to-halt!&nbsp;
Reverence, then, and almost worship thy staff!&nbsp; Throw all thy weight
upon thy staff.&nbsp; Confide all thy weakness to it.&nbsp; Talk to
it as thou walkest with it.&nbsp; Make it talk to thee.&nbsp; Worm out
of it all its secrets about its first Owner.&nbsp; And let it instruct
thee about how He walked with it and how He handled it.&nbsp; The Bible
is very bold with its Master.&nbsp; It calls Him by the most startling
names sometimes.&nbsp; There is no name that a penitent and a returning
sinner goes by that the Bible does not put somewhere upon the sinner&rsquo;s
Saviour.&nbsp; And in one place it as good as calls Him Ready-to-halt
in as many words.&nbsp; Nay, it lets us see Him halting altogether for
a time; ay, oftener than once; and only taking the road again, when
a still stronger staff was put into his trembling hand.&nbsp; And if
John had but had room in his crowded gospel he would have given us the
very identical psalm with which our Lord took to the upward way again,
strong in His new staff.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I am ready to halt,&rdquo;
was His psalm in the house of His pilgrimage, &ldquo;and My sorrow is
continually before Me.&nbsp; Mine enemies are lively, and they are strong;
and they that hate Me wrongfully are multiplied.&nbsp; They also that
render evil for good are Mine adversaries; because I follow the thing
that good is.&nbsp; Forsake Me not, O Lord; O My God, be not far from
Me.&nbsp; Make haste to help Me, O Lord My salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Among all the devout and beautiful fables of the &ldquo;dispensation
of paganism,&rdquo; there is nothing finer than the fable of blind Tiresias
and his staff.&nbsp; By some sad calamity this old prophet had lost
the sight of his eyes, and to compensate their servant for that great
loss the gods endowed him with a staff with eyes.&nbsp; As Aaron&rsquo;s
rod budded before the testimony and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds,
so Tiresias&rsquo; staff budded eyes, and divine eyes too, for the blind
prophet&rsquo;s guidance and direction.&nbsp; Tiresias had but to take
his heaven-given staff in his hand, when, straightway, such a divinity
entered into the staff that it both saw for him with divine eyes, and
heard for him with divine ears, and then led him and directed him, and
never once in all his after journeys let him go off the right way.&nbsp;
All other men about him, prophets and priests both, often lost their
way, but Tiresias after his blindness, never, till Tiresias and his
staff became a proverb and a parable in the land.&nbsp; And just such
a staff, just such a crutch, just such a pair of crutches, were the
crutches of our own so homely Mr. Ready-to-halt.&nbsp; With all their
lusty limbs, all the other pilgrims often stumbled and went out of their
way till they had to be helped up, led back, and their faces set right
again.&nbsp; But, last as Mr. Ready-to-halt always came in the procession&mdash;behind
even the women and the children as his crutches always kept him&mdash;you
will seek in vain for the dot of those crutches on any by-path or on
any wrong road.&nbsp; No; the fact is, if you wish to go to the same
city, and are afraid you lose the way; as Evangelist said, &ldquo;Do
you see yon shining light?&rdquo; so I would say to you to-night, &ldquo;Do
you see these crutch-marks on the road?&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, keep your
feet in the prints of these crutches, and as sure as you do that they
will lead you straight to a chariot and horses, which, again, will carry
you inside the city gates.&nbsp; For Mr. Ready-to-halt&rsquo;s crutches
have not only eyes like Tiresias&rsquo; staff, they have ears also,
and hands and feet.&nbsp; A lamp also burns on those crutches; and wine
and oil distil from their wonderful wood.&nbsp; Happy blindness that
brings such a staff!&nbsp; Happy exchange! eyes full of earth and sin
for eyes full of heaven and holiness!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;They began to be merry,&rdquo; says our Lord, telling
the story of the heart-broken father who had got back his younger son
from a far country.&nbsp; And even Feeble-mind and Ready-to-halt begin
to be merry on the green that day after Doubting Castle has fallen to
Greatheart&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Now, Christiana, if need was, could play
upon the viol, and her daughter Mercy upon the lute; and, since they
were so merry disposed, she played them a lesson, and Mr. Ready-to-halt
would dance.&nbsp; So he paid a boy a penny to hold one of his crutches,
and, taking Miss Much-afraid by the hand, to dancing they went.&nbsp;
And, I promise you he footed it well; the lame man leaped as an hart;
also the girl was to be commended, for she answered the music handsomely.&nbsp;
In spite of his life-long infirmity, there was deep down in Mr. Ready-to-halt
an unsuspected fund of good-humour.&nbsp; There was no heartier merriment
on the green that day than was the merriment that Mr. Ready-to-halt
knocked out of his nimble crutch.&nbsp; &ldquo;True, he could not dance
without one crutch in his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, dear and noble Bunyan,
thou canst not write a single page at any time or on any subject without
thy genius and thy tenderness and thy divine grace marking the page
as thine own alone!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The next time we see Mr. Ready-to-halt he is coming in on
his crutches to see Christiana, for she has sent for him to see him.&nbsp;
So she said to him, &ldquo;Thy travel hither hath been with difficulty,
but that will make thy rest the sweeter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then in process
of time there came a post to the town and his business this time was
with Mr. Ready-to-halt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am come to thee in the name of
Him whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon crutches.&nbsp; And
my message is to tell thee that He expects thee at His table to sup
with Him in His kingdom the next day after Easter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am sent for,&rdquo; said Mr. Ready-to-halt to his fellow-pilgrims, &ldquo;and
God shall surely visit you also.&nbsp; These crutches,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I bequeath to my son that shall tread in my steps, with an hundred
warm wishes that he may prove better than I have done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Isaac was a child of promise, and Mr. Ready-to-halt had an Isaac also
on whom his last thoughts turned.&nbsp; Isaac had been born to Abraham
by a special and extraordinary and supernatural interposition of the
grace and the power of God; and Mr. Ready-to-halt had always looked
on himself as a second Abraham in that respect.&nbsp; A second Abraham,
and more.&nbsp; True, his son was not yet a pilgrim; perhaps he was
too young to be so called; but Greatheart will take back the old man&rsquo;s
crutches&mdash;Greatheart was both man-of-war and beast-of-burden to
the pilgrims and their wives and children&mdash;and will in spare hours
teach young Ready-to-halt the use of the crutch, till the son can use
with the same effect as his father his father&rsquo;s instrument.&nbsp;
Is your child a child of promise?&nbsp; Is he to you a product of nature,
or of grace?&nbsp; Did you receive him and his brothers and sisters
from God after you were as good as dead?&nbsp; Did you ever steal in
when his nurse was at supper and say over his young cradle, He hath
not dealt with me after my sins, nor rewarded me according to my iniquities?&nbsp;
Is it in your will laid up with Christ in God about your crutches and
your son what Mr. Ready-to-halt dictated on his deathbed?&nbsp; And
does God know that there is no wish in your old heart a hundred times
so warm for your son as is this wish,&mdash;that he may prove better
at handling God&rsquo;s promises than you have been?&nbsp; Then, happy
son, who has old Mr. Ready-to-halt for his father!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &ldquo;He whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon
crutches, expects thee at His table the next day after Easter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Take comfort, cripples!&nbsp; Had it been said that the King so expects
Greatheart, or Standfast, or Valiant-for-truth, that would have been
after the manner of the kings of this world.&nbsp; But to insist on
having Mr. Ready-to-halt beside Him by such and such a day; to send
such a post to a pilgrim who has not a single sound bone in all his
body; to a sinner without a single trustworthy grace in all his heart;
to a poor and simple believer who has nothing in his hand but one of
God&rsquo;s own promises&mdash;Who is a king like unto our King?&nbsp;
Surely King David was never a better type of Christ than when he said
to Mephibosheth, lame in both his feet from his nurse&rsquo;s arms:
&ldquo;Fear not, Mephibosheth, for I will surely show thee kindness,
and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mephibosheth
shall always be our spokesman when he bows himself and says in return:
&ldquo;What is thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead
dog as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VALIANT-FOR-TRUTH</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;They are not valiant for the truth.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jeremiah</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Ye should contend earnestly for the faith.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jude</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget not Master Valiant-for-the-Truth,<br />
That man of courage, tho&rsquo; a very youth.<br />
Tell every one his spirit was so stout,<br />
No man could ever make him face about.&rdquo;<br />
<i>Bunyan</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am of Dark-land, for there was I born, and there my father
and mother are still.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dark-land,&rdquo; said the
guide; &ldquo;doth not that lie upon the same coast as the City of Destruction?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, it doth,&rdquo; replied Valiant-for-truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
had I not found incommodity there, I had not forsaken it at all; but
finding it altogether unsuitable to me, and very unprofitable for me,
I forsook it for this way.&nbsp; Now, that which caused me to come on
pilgrimage was this.&nbsp; We had one Mr. Tell-true came into our parts,
and he told it about what Christian had done, that went from the City
of Destruction.&nbsp; That man so told the story of Christian and his
travels that my heart fell into a burning haste to be gone after him,
nor could my father and mother stay me, so I got from them, and am come
thus far on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A very plain and practical lesson is already read to us
all in Valiant-for-truth&rsquo;s explanation of his own pilgrimage.&nbsp;
He tells the guide that he was made a pilgrim just by having the story
of The Pilgrim told to him.&nbsp; All that Tell-true did was just to
recite the story of the pilgrim, when young Valiant&rsquo;s heart fell
into a burning haste to be a pilgrim too.&nbsp; My brethren, could any
lesson be plainer?&nbsp; Read the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> with
your children.&nbsp; And, after a time, read it again till they call
it beautiful, and till you see the same burning haste in their hearts
that young Valiant felt in his heart.&nbsp; Circulate the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>.&nbsp; Make opportunities to give the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> to the telegraph boys and errand boys at your door.&nbsp;
Never go on a holiday without taking a dozen cheap and tasteful copies
of <i>The Pilgrim</i> to give to boys and girls in the country.&nbsp;
Make sure that no one, old or young, of your acquaintance, in town or
country, is without a good copy of <i>The Pilgrim</i>.&nbsp; And the
darker their house is, make all the more sure that John Bunyan is in
it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now may this little book a blessing be,<br />
To those that love this little book and me<br />
And may its buyer have no cause to say<br />
His money is but lost or thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; But the great lesson of Valiant&rsquo;s so impressive life
lies in the tremendous fight he had with three ruffians who all set
upon him at once and well-nigh made an end of him.&nbsp; For, when we
put by the curtains here again, and turn up the metaphors, what do we
find?&nbsp; What, but a lesson of first-rate importance for many men
among ourselves; for many public men, many ministers, and many other
much-in-earnest men.&nbsp; For Valiant, as his name tells us, was set
to contend for the truth.&nbsp; He had the truth.&nbsp; The truth was
put into his keeping, and he was bound to defend it.&nbsp; He was thrown
into a life of controversy, and thus into all the terrible temptations&mdash;worse
than the temptations to whoredom or wine&mdash;that accompany a life
of controversy.&nbsp; The three scoundrels that fell upon Valiant at
the mouth of the lane were Wildhead, Inconsiderate, and Pragmatic.&nbsp;
In other words, the besetting temptations of many men who are set as
defenders of the truth in religion, as well as in other matters, is
to be wild-headed, inconsiderate, self-conceited, and intolerably arrogant.&nbsp;
The bloody battle that Valiant fought, you must know, was not fought
at the mouth of any dark lane in the midnight city, nor on the side
of any lonely road in the moonless country.&nbsp; This terrible fight
was fought in Valiant&rsquo;s own heart.&nbsp; For Valiant was none
of your calculating and cold-blooded friends of the truth.&nbsp; He
did not wait till he saw the truth walking in silver slippers.&nbsp;
Let any man lay a finger on the truth, or wag a tongue against the truth,
and he will have to settle it with Valiant.&nbsp; His love for the truth
was a passion.&nbsp; There was a fierceness in his love for the truth
that frightened ordinary men even when they were on his own side.&nbsp;
Valiant would have died for the truth without a murmur.&nbsp; But, with
all that, Valiant had to learn a hard and a cruel lesson.&nbsp; He had
to learn that he, the best friend of truth as he thought he was, was
at the same time, as a matter of fact, the greatest enemy that the truth
had.&nbsp; He had to take home the terrible discovery that no man had
hurt the truth so much as he had done.&nbsp; Save me from my friend!
the truth was heard to say, as often as she saw him taking up his weapons
in her behalf.&nbsp; We see all that every day.&nbsp; We see Wildhead
at his disservice of the truth every day.&nbsp; Sometimes above his
own name, and sometimes with grace enough to be ashamed to give his
name, in the newspapers.&nbsp; Sometimes on the platform; sometimes
in the pulpit; and sometimes at the dinner-table.&nbsp; But always to
the detriment of the truth.&nbsp; In blind fury he rushes at the character
and the good name of men who were servants of the truth before he was
born, and whose shield he is not worthy to bear.&nbsp; How shall Wildhead
be got to see that he and the like of him are really the worst friends
the truth can possibly have?&nbsp; Will he never learn that in his wild-bull
gorings at men and at movements, he is both hurting himself and hurting
the truth as no sworn enemy of his and of the truth can do?&nbsp; Will
he never see what an insolent fool he is to go on imputing bad motives
to other men, when he ought to be prostrate before God on account of
his own?&nbsp; More than one wild-headed student of William Law has
told me what a blessing they have got from that great man&rsquo;s teaching
on the subject of controversy.&nbsp; Will the Wildheads here to-night
take a line or two out of that peace-making author and lay them to heart?&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear L-, take notice of this, that no truths, however solid
and well-grounded, will help you to any divine life, but only so far
as they are taught, nourished, and strengthened by an unction from above;
and that nothing more dries and extinguishes this heavenly unction than
a talkative reasoning temper that is always catching at every opportunity
of hearing or telling some religious matters.&nbsp; Stop your ears and
shut your eyes to all religious tales . . . I would no more bring a
false charge against a deist than I would bear false witness against
an apostle.&nbsp; And if I knew how to do the deists more justice in
debate I would gladly do it . . . And as the gospel requires me to be
as glad to see piety, equity, strict sobriety, and extensive charity
in a Jew or a Gentile as in a Christian; as it obliges me to look with
pleasure upon their virtues, and to be thankful to God that such persons
have so much of true and sound Christianity in them; so it cannot be
an unchristian spirit to be as glad to see truths in one party of Christians
as in another, and to look with pleasure upon any good doctrines that
are held by any sect of Christian people, and to be thankful to God
that they have so much of the genuine saving truths of the gospel among
them . . . Selfishness and partiality are very inhuman and base qualities
even in the things of this world, but in the doctrines of religion they
are of a far baser nature.&nbsp; In the present divided state of the
Church, truth itself is torn and divided asunder; and, therefore, he
is the only true Catholic who has more of truth and less of error than
is hedged in by any divided part.&nbsp; To see this will enable us to
live in a divided part unhurt by its division, and keep us in a true
liberty and fitness to be edified and assisted by all the good that
we hear or see in any other part of the Church.&nbsp; And thus, uniting
in heart and spirit with all that is holy and good in all Churches,
we enter into the true communion of saints, and become real members
of the Holy Catholic Church, though we are confined to the outward worship
of only one particular part of it.&nbsp; And thus we will like no truth
the less because Ignatius Loyola or John Bunyan were very jealous for
it, nor have the less aversion to any error because Dr. Trapp or George
Fox had brought it forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Wildhead would take a winter
of William Law, it would sweeten his temper, and civilise his manners,
and renew his heart.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Inconsiderate, again, is the shallow creature he is, and
does the endless mischief that he does, largely for lack of imagination.&nbsp;
He never thinks&mdash;neither before he speaks nor after he has spoken.&nbsp;
He never put himself in another man&rsquo;s place all his days.&nbsp;
He is incapable of doing that.&nbsp; He has neither the head nor the
heart to do that.&nbsp; He never once said, How would I like that said
about me? or, How would I like that done to me? or, How would that look
and taste and feel to me if I were in So-and-so&rsquo;s place?&nbsp;
It needs genius to change places with other men; it needs a grace beyond
all genius; and this poor headless and heartless creature does not know
what genius is.&nbsp; It needs imagination, the noblest gift of the
mind, and it needs love, the noblest grace of the heart, to consider
the case of other people, and to see, as Butler says, that we differ
as much from other people as they differ from us.&nbsp; And it is by
far the noblest use of the imagination, far nobler than carving a Laocoon,
or painting a Last Judgment, or writing a &ldquo;Paradiso&rdquo; or
a &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; to put ourselves into the places of other
men so as to see with their eyes, and feel with their hearts, and sympathise
with their principles, and even with their prejudices.&nbsp; Now, the
inconsiderate man has so little imagination and so little love that
he is sitting here and does not know what I am saying; and what suspicion
he has of what I am saying is just enough to make him dislike both me
and what I am saying too.&nbsp; But his dull suspicion and his blind
dislike are more than made up for by the love and appreciation of those
lovers and defenders of the truth who painfully feel how wild and inconsiderate,
how hot-headed, how thoughtless, and how reckless their past service
even of God&rsquo;s truth has been.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The King is full of grace and fair regard.<br />
Consideration, like an angel, came<br />
And whipp&rsquo;d the offending Adam out of him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.&nbsp; And as to Pragmatic, I would not call you a stupid person
even though you confided to me that you had never heard this footpad&rsquo;s
name till to-night.&nbsp; John Bunyan has been borrowing Latin again,
and not to the improvement of his style, or to the advantage of his
readers.&nbsp; It would be insufferably pragmatic in me to begin to
set John Bunyan right in his English; but I had rather offend the shades
of a hundred John Bunyans than leave my most unlettered hearer without
his full and proper Sabbath-night lesson.&nbsp; The third armed thief,
then, that fell upon Valiant was, under other names, Impertinence, Meddlesomeness,
Officiousness, Over-Interference.&nbsp; Pragmatic,&mdash;by whatever
name he calls himself, there is no mistaking him.&nbsp; He is never
satisfied.&nbsp; He is never pleased.&nbsp; He is never thankful.&nbsp;
He is always setting his superiors right.&nbsp; He is like the Psalmist
in one thing, he has more understanding than all his teachers.&nbsp;
And he enjoys nothing more than in letting them know that.&nbsp; There
is nothing he will not correct you in&mdash;from cutting for the stone
to commanding the Channel Fleet.&nbsp; Now, if all that has put any
visual image of Pragmatic into your mind, you will see at once what
an enemy he too is fitted to be to the truth.&nbsp; For the truth does
not stand in points, but in principles.&nbsp; The truth does not dwell
in the letter but in the spirit.&nbsp; The truth is not served by setting
other people right, but by seeing every day and in every thing how far
wrong we are ourselves.&nbsp; The truth is like charity in this, that
it begins at home.&nbsp; It is like charity in this also, that it never
behaves itself unseemly.&nbsp; A pragmatical man, taken along with an
inconsiderate man, and then a wild-headed man added on to them, are
three about as fatal hands as any truth could fall into.&nbsp; The worst
enemy of the truth must pity the truth, and feel his hatred at the truth
relenting, when he sees her under the championship of Wildhead, Inconsiderate,
and Pragmatic.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The first time we see Valiant-for-truth he is standing at
the mouth of Dead-man&rsquo;s-lane with his sword in his hand and with
his face all bloody.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have left upon me, as you see,&rdquo;
said the bleeding man, &ldquo;some of the marks of their valour, and
have also carried away with them some of mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, in
like manner, we see Paul with the blood of Barnabas still upon him when
he is writing the thirteenth of First Corinthians; and John with the
blood of the Samaritans still upon him down to his old age when he is
writing his First Epistle; and John Bunyan with the blood of the Quakers
upon him when he is covertly writing this page of his autobiography
under the veil of Valiant-for-truth; and William Law with the blood
of Bishop Hoadly and John Wesley dropping on the paper as he pens that
golden passage which ends with Dr. Trapp and George Fox.&nbsp; Where
did you think Paul got that splendid passage about charity?&nbsp; Where
did you think William Law got that companion passage about Church divisions,
and about the Church Catholic?&nbsp; Where are such passages ever got
by inspired apostles, or by any other men, but out of their own bloody
battles with their own wild-headedness, intolerance, dislike, and resentment?&nbsp;
Where do you suppose I got the true key to the veiled metaphor of Valiant-for-truth?&nbsp;
It does not exactly hang on the doorpost of his history.&nbsp; Where,
then, could I get it but off the inside wall of my own place of repentance?&nbsp;
Just as you understand what I am now labouring to say, not from my success
in saying it, but from your own trespasses against humility and love,
your unadvised speeches, and your wild and whirling words.&nbsp; Without
shame and remorse, without self-condemnation and self-contempt, none
of those great passages of Paul, or John, or Bunyan, or Law were ever
written; and without a like shame, remorse, self-condemnation, and self-contempt
they are not rightly read.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh! who shall dare in this frail scene<br />
On holiest, happiest thoughts to lean,<br />
On Friendship, Kindred, or on Love?<br />
Since not Apostles&rsquo; hands can clasp<br />
Each other in so firm a grasp,<br />
But they shall change and variance prove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sometimes even beneath the moon<br />
The Saviour gives a gracious boon,<br />
When reconciled Christians meet,<br />
And face to face, and heart to heart,<br />
High thoughts of Holy love impart<br />
In silence meek, or converse sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh then the glory and the bliss<br />
When all that pained or seemed amiss<br />
Shall melt with earth and sin away!<br />
When saints beneath their Saviour&rsquo;s eye,<br />
Filled with each other&rsquo;s company,<br />
Shall spend in love the eternal day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.&nbsp; Then said Greatheart to Mr. Valiant-for-truth, &ldquo;Thou
hast worthily behaved thyself; let me see thy sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
he showed it him.&nbsp; When he had taken it in his hand and had looked
thereon a while, the guide said: &ldquo;Ha! it is a right Jerusalem
blade!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; replied its owner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let a man have one of these blades with a hand to wield it, and
skill to use it, and he may venture upon an angel with it.&nbsp; Its
edges will never blunt.&nbsp; It will cut flesh, and bones, and soul,
and spirit, and all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both Damascus and Toledo blades were
famous in former days for their tenacity and flexibility, and for the
beauty and the edge of their steel.&nbsp; But even a Damascus blade
would be worthless in a weak, cowardly, or unskilled hand; while even
a poor sword in the hand of a good swordsman will do excellent execution.&nbsp;
And much more so when you have both a first-rate sword and a first-rate
swordsman, such as both Valiant and his Jerusalem blade were.&nbsp;
Ha! yes.&nbsp; This is a right wonderful blade we have now in our hand.&nbsp;
For this sword was forged in no earthly fire; and it was whetted to
its unapproachable sharpness on no earthly whetstone.&nbsp; But, best
of all for us, when a good soldier of Jesus Christ has this sword girt
on his thigh he is able then to go forth against himself with it; against
his own only and worst enemy&mdash;that is, against himself.&nbsp; As
here, against his own wildness of head and pride of heart.&nbsp; Against
his own want of consideration also.&nbsp; &ldquo;My people do not consider.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As also against himself as a lawless invader of other men&rsquo;s freedom
of judgment, following of truth, public honour, and good name.&nbsp;
As the Arabian warriors see themselves and dress themselves in their
swords as in a glass, so did Valiant-for-truth see the thoughts and
intents, the joints and the marrow of his own disordered soul in his
Jerusalem blade.&nbsp; In the sheen of it he could see himself even
when the darkness covered him; and with its two edges all his after-life
he slew both all real error in other men and all real evil in himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou hast done well,&rdquo; said Greatheart the guide.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou hast resisted unto blood, striving against sin.&nbsp; Thou
shalt abide by us, come in and go out with us, for we are thy companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the widow indeed to Valiant-for-truth,
&ldquo;sir, you have in all places shown yourself true-hearted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The first time she ever saw this man that she is now seeing for the
last time on this side the river, his own mother would not have known
him, he was so hacked to pieces with the swords of his three assailants.&nbsp;
But as she washed the blood off the mangled man&rsquo;s head and face
and hands, she soon saw beneath all his bloody wounds a true, a brave,
and a generous-hearted soldier of the Cross.&nbsp; The heart is always
the man.&nbsp; And this woman had lived long enough with men to have
discovered that.&nbsp; And with all his sears she saw that it was at
bottom the truth of his heart that had cast him into so many bloody
encounters.&nbsp; There were men in that company, and men near the river
too, with far fewer marks of battle, and even of defeat, upon them,
who did not get this noble certificate and its accompanying charge and
trust from this clear-eyed widow.&nbsp; And, then, she had never forgot&mdash;how
could she?&mdash;his exclamation, and almost embrace of her as of his
own mother, when he burst out with his eyes full of blood, &ldquo;Why,
is this Christian&rsquo;s wife?&nbsp; What! and going on pilgrimage
too?&nbsp; It glads my heart!&nbsp; Good man!&nbsp; How joyful will
he be when he shall see her and her children enter after him in at the
gates into the city!&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have been hacked a hundred
times worse than he was before the widow of Christian, and the mother
of his children, would have seen anything but the manliest beauty in
a young soldier who could salute an old woman in that way.&nbsp; It
gladdened her heart to hear him, you may be sure, as much as it gladdened
his heart to see her.&nbsp; And that was the reason that she actually
set Greatheart himself aside, and left her children under this young
man&rsquo;s sword and shield.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would also entreat you
to have an eye to my children,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Young men, has
any dying mother committed her children, if you at any time see them
faint, to you?&nbsp; Have you ever spoken so comfortably to any poor
widow about her sainted husband that she has passed by some of our foremost
citizens, and has astonished and offended her lawyers by putting a stripling
like you into the trusteeship?&nbsp; Did ever any dying mother say to
you that she had seen you to be so true-hearted at all times that she
entreated you to have an eye to her children?&nbsp; Speaking at this
point for myself, I would rather see my son so trusted at such an hour
by such a woman than I would see him the Chancellor of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Exchequer, or the Governor of the Bank of England.&nbsp; And so to-night
would you.</p>
<h2>STANDFAST</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his supplementary picture of Standfast John Bunyan is seen at
his very best, both as a religious teacher and as an English author.&nbsp;
On the Enchanted Ground Standfast is set before us with extraordinary
insight, sagacity, and wisdom; and then in the terrible river he is
set before us with an equally extraordinary rapture and transport; while,
in all that, Bunyan composes in English of a strength and a beauty and
a music in which he positively surpasses himself.&nbsp; Just before
he closes his great book John Bunyan rises up and once more puts forth
his very fullest strength, both as a minister of religion and as a classical
writer, when he takes Standfast down into that river which that pilgrim
tells us has been such a terror to so many, and the thought of which
has so often affrighted himself.</p>
<p>When Greatheart and his charge were almost at the end of the Enchanted
Ground, so we read, they perceived that a little before them was a solemn
noise as of one that was much concerned.&nbsp; So they went on and looked
before them.&nbsp; And behold, they saw, as they thought, a man upon
his knees, with hands and eyes lift up, and speaking, as they thought,
earnestly to one that was above.&nbsp; They drew nigh, but could not
tell what he said; so they went softly till he had done.&nbsp; When
he had done, he got up and began to run towards the Celestial City.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So-ho, friend, let us have your company,&rdquo; called out the
guide.&nbsp; At that the man stopped, and they came up to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know this man,&rdquo; said Mr. Honest; &ldquo;his name, I know,
is Standfast, and he is certainly a right good pilgrim.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then follows a conversation between Mr. Honest and Mr. Standfast, in
which some compliments and courtesies are exchanged, such as are worthy
of such men, met at such a time and in such a place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
but, brother,&rdquo; said Valiant-for-truth, &ldquo;tell us, I pray
thee, what was it that was the cause of thy being upon thy knees even
now?&nbsp; Was it for that some special mercy laid obligations upon
thee, or how?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then Standfast tells how as he was coming
along musing with himself, Madam Bubble presented herself to him and
offered him three things.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was both aweary and sleepy
and also as poor as a howlet, and all that the wicked witch knew.&nbsp;
And still she followed me with her enticements.&nbsp; Then I betook
me, as you saw, to my knees, and with hands lift up and cries, I prayed
to Him who had said that He would help.&nbsp; So just as you came up
the gentlewoman went her way.&nbsp; Then I continued to give thanks
for my great deliverance; for I verify believe she intended me no good,
but rather sought to make stop of me in my journey.&nbsp; What a mercy
is it that I did resist her, for whither might she not have drawn me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then, after all this discourse, there was a mixture of joy and trembling
among the pilgrims, but at last they broke out and sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What danger is the pilgrim in,<br />
How many are his foes,<br />
How many ways there are to sin,<br />
No living mortal knows!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, as I was coming along I was musing with myself,&rdquo;
said Standfast.&nbsp; You understand what it is to come along musing
with yourself, do you not, my brethren?&nbsp; &ldquo;I will muse on
the work of Thy hands,&rdquo; says the Psalmist.&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;While
I was musing the fire burned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, Standfast was much
given to musing, just as David was.&nbsp; Each several pilgrim has his
own way of occupying himself on the road; but Standfast could never
get his fill just of musing.&nbsp; Standfast loved solitude.&nbsp; Standfast
liked nothing better than to walk long stretches at a time all by himself
alone.&nbsp; Standfast was like the apostle when he preferred to take
the twenty miles from Troas to Assos on foot and alone, rather than
to round the cape on shipboard in a crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minding himself
to go afoot,&rdquo; says the apostle&rsquo;s companion.&nbsp; It would
have made a precious chapter in the Acts of the Apostles had the author
of that book been able to give his readers some of Paul&rsquo;s musings
as he crossed the Troad on foot that day.&nbsp; But in the absence of
Paul&rsquo;s musings we have here the musings of a man whom Paul would
not have shaken off had he foregathered with him on that lonely road.&nbsp;
For Standfast was in a deep and serious muse mile after mile, when,
who should step into the middle of his path right before him but Madam
Bubble with her body and her purse and her bed?&nbsp; Now, had this
hungry howlet of a pilgrim been at that moment in any other but a musing
mood of mind, he had to a certainty sold himself, soul and body, Celestial
City and all, to that impudent slut.&nbsp; But, as He would have it
who overrules Madam Bubble&rsquo;s descents, and all things, Standfast
was at that moment in one of his most musing moods, and all her smiles
and all her offers fell flat and poor upon him.&nbsp; Cultivate Standfast&rsquo;s
mood of mind, my brethren.&nbsp; Walk a good deal alone.&nbsp; Strike
across country from time to time alone and have good long walks and
talks with yourself.&nbsp; And when you know that you are passing places
of temptation see that your thoughts, and even your imaginations, are
well occupied with solemn considerations about the certain issue of
such and such temptations; and then, to you, as to Standfast,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The arrow seen beforehand slacks its flight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, musing alone, the arrow seen beforehand, and all, Standfast
would have been a lost man on that lonely road that day had he not instantly
betaken himself to his knees.&nbsp; And it was while Standfast was still
on his knees that the ascending pilgrims heard that concerned and solemn
noise a little ahead of them.&nbsp; Did you ever suddenly come across
a man on his knees?&nbsp; Did you ever surprise a man at prayer as Greatheart
and his companions surprised Standfast?&nbsp; I do not ask, Did you
ever enter a room and find a family around their morning or evening
altar?&nbsp; We have all done that.&nbsp; And it left its own impression
upon us.&nbsp; But did you ever spring a surprise upon a man on his
knees alone and in broad daylight?&nbsp; I did the other day.&nbsp;
It was between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon when
I asked a clerk if his master was in.&nbsp; Yes, he said, and opened
his master&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; When, before I was aware, I had almost
fallen over a man on his knees and with his face in his hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I pray thee,&rdquo; said Valiant-for-truth, &ldquo;tell us what
it was that drew thee to thy knees even now.&nbsp; Was it that some
special mercy laid its obligations on thee, or how?&rdquo;&nbsp; I did
not say that exactly to my kneeling friend, though it was on the point
of my tongue to say it.&nbsp; My dear friend, I knew, had his own difficulties,
though he was not exactly as poor as a howlet.&nbsp; And it might have
been about some of his investments that had gone out of joint that he
went that forenoon to Him who had said that He would help.&nbsp; Or,
like the author of the <i>Christian Perfection</i> and <i>The Spirit
of Prayer</i>, it was the sixth hour of the day, and he may have gone
to his knees for his clerks, or for his boys at school, or for himself
and for the man in the same business with himself right across the street.&nbsp;
I knew that my friend had the charming book at home in which such counsels
as these occur: &ldquo;If masters were thus to remember their servants,
beseeching God to bless them, letting no day pass without a full performance
of this devotion, the benefit would be as great to themselves as to
their servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; And perhaps my friend, after setting his
clerks their several tasks for the day, was now asking grace of God
for each one of them that they might not be eye-servants and men-pleasers,
but the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart.&nbsp;
Or, again, he may have read in that noble book this passage: &ldquo;If
a father were daily to make some particular prayer to God that He would
please to inspire his children with true piety, great humility, and
strict temperance, what could be more likely to make the father himself
become exemplary in these virtues?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, my friend (who
can tell?) may just that morning have lost his temper with his son;
or he may last night have indulged himself too much in eating, or in
drinking, or in debate, or in detraction; and that may have made it
impossible for him to fix his whole mind on his office work that morning.&nbsp;
Or, just to make another guess, when he opened the book I had asked
him to buy and read, he may have lighted on this heavenly passage: &ldquo;Lastly,
if all people when they feel the first approaches of resentment or envy
or contempt towards others; or if in all little disagreements and misunderstandings
whatever they should have recourse at such times to a more particular
and extraordinary intercession with God for such persons as had roused
their envy, resentment, or discontent&mdash;this would be a certain
way to prevent the growth of all uncharitable tempers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
You may think that I am taking a roundabout way of accounting for my
friend&rsquo;s so concerned attitude at twelve o&rsquo;clock that business
day; but the whole thing seemed to me so unusual at such a time and
in such a place that I was led to such guesses as these to account for
it.&nbsp; In so guessing I see now that I was intruding myself into
matters I had no business with; but all that day I could not keep my
mind off my blushing friend.&nbsp; For, like Mr. Standfast, my dear
friend blushed as he stood up and offered me the chair he had been kneeling
at.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, why, did you see me?&rdquo; said Mr. Standfast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; quoth the other, &ldquo;and with all my heart
I was glad at the sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what did you think?&rdquo;
said Mr. Standfast.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it,&rdquo; asked Valiant-for-truth, in a holy
curiosity, &ldquo;was it some special mercy that brought thee to thy
knees even now?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; Valiant-for-truth had exactly hit
it.&nbsp; Gracious wits, like great wits, jump together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
confessed Standfast, &ldquo;I continue to give thanks for my great deliverance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
My brethren, you all pray importunately in your time of sore trouble.&nbsp;
Everybody does that.&nbsp; But do you feel an obligation, like Standfast,
to abide still on your knees long after your trouble is past?&nbsp;
Nature herself will teach us to pray; but it needs grace, and great
grace continually renewed, to teach us to praise, and to continue all
our days to praise.&nbsp; How we once prayed, ay, as earnestly, and
as concernedly, and as careless as to who should see or hear us as Standfast
himself!&nbsp; How some of us here to-night used to walk across a whole
country all the time praying!&nbsp; How we hoodwinked people in order
to get away from them to pray for twenty miles at a time all by ourselves!&nbsp;
Under that bush&mdash;it still stands to mark the spot; in that wood,
long since cut down into ploughed land&mdash;we could show our children
the spot to this day where we prayed, till a miracle was wrought in
our behalf.&nbsp; Yes, till God sent from above and took us as He never
took a psalmist, and set our feet upon a still more wonderful rock.&nbsp;
How He, yes, HE, with His own hand cut the cords, broke the net, and
set us free!&nbsp; Come, all ye that fear God! we then said, and said
it with all sincerity too.&nbsp; And yet, how have we forgotten what
He did for our soul?&nbsp; We start like a guilty thing surprised when
we think how long it is since we had a spell of thanksgiving.&nbsp;
Shame on us!&nbsp; What treacherous hearts we have!&nbsp; What short
memories we have!&nbsp; How soon we forgive ourselves, and so forget
the forgiveness of our God!&nbsp; Brethren, let us still lay plans for
praise as we used to do for prayer.&nbsp; If our friends will go out
with us, let us at least insist on walking home alone.&nbsp; Let us
say with Paul that we get sick at sea; and, besides, that we have some
calls to make and some small accounts to settle before we leave the
country.&nbsp; Tell them not to wait dinner for us.&nbsp; And then let
us take plenty of time.&nbsp; Let us stop at all our old stations and
call back all our old terrors; let us repeat aloud our old psalms&mdash;the
twenty-fifth, the fifty-first, the hundred and third, and the hundred
and thirtieth.&nbsp; We used to terrify people with our prayers as Standfast
terrified the young pilgrims that day; let us surprise and delight them
now with our psalms of thanksgiving.&nbsp; For, with all our disgraceful
ingratitude in the past, if William Law is right, we are even yet not
far from being great saints, if he is not wrong when he asks: &ldquo;Would
you know who is the greatest saint in the world?&nbsp; It is not he
who prays most or fasts most; it is not he who gives most alms, or is
most eminent for temperance, chastity, or justice.&nbsp; But it is he
who is most thankful to God, and who has a heart always ready to praise
God.&nbsp; This is the perfection of all virtues.&nbsp; Joy in God and
thankfulness to God is the highest perfection of a divine and holy life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, then, what an endless cause of joy and thankfulness have we!&nbsp;
Let us acknowledge it, and henceforth employ it; and we shall, please
God, even yet be counted as not low down but high up among the saints
and the servants of God.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Christiana said many kind and wise and beautiful things
to all the other pilgrims before she entered the river, but it was observed
that though she sent for Mr. Standfast, she said not one word to him
when he came; she just gave him her ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;The touch is
human and affecting,&rdquo; says Mr. Louis Stevenson, in his delightful
paper on Bagster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bunyan,&rdquo; in the <i>Magazine of
Art</i>.&nbsp; By the way, do you who are lovers of Bunyan literature
know that remarkable and delicious paper?&nbsp; The Messrs. Bagster
should secure that paper and should issue an <i>edition de luxe</i>
of their neglected &ldquo;Bunyan,&rdquo; with Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s
paper for a preface and introduction.&nbsp; Bagster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Illustrated
Bunyan,&rdquo; with an introduction on the illustrations by Mr. Louis
Stevenson, if I am not much mistaken, would sell by the thousand.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Lord Rosebery knows books and loves books, and he has called
attention to the surpassing beauty of the English in the deathbed scenes
of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; And every lover of pure,
tender, and noble English must, like the Foreign Secretary, have all
those precious pages by heart.&nbsp; Were it not that we all have a
cowardly fear at death ourselves, and think it wicked and cruel even
to hint at his approaching death even to a fast-dying man, we would
never let any of our friends lie down on his sick-bed without having
a reassuring and victorious page of the <i>Pilgrim</i> read to him every
day.&nbsp; If the doctors would allow me, I would have these heavenly
pages reprinted in sick-bed type for all my people.&nbsp; But I am afraid
at the doctors.&nbsp; And thus one after another of my people passes
away without the fortification and the foretaste that the deathbeds
of Christian, and Christiana, and Hopeful, and Mr. Fearing, and Mr.
Feeble-mind, and Mr. Honest, and Mr. Standfast would most surely have
given to them.&nbsp; Especially the deathbed, if I must so call it,
of Mr. Standfast.&nbsp; But as Christiana said nothing that could be
heard to Mr. Standfast about his or her latter end, but just looked
into his eyes and gave him her ring, so I may not be able to say all
that is in my heart when your doctor is standing close by.&nbsp; But
you will understand what I would fain say, will you not?&nbsp; You will
remember, and will have this heavenly book read to you alternately with
your Bible, will you not?&nbsp; Even the most godless doctor will give
way to you when you tell him that you know as well as he does just how
it is with you, and that you are to have your own way for the last time.&nbsp;
I know a doctor who first forbade her minister and her family to tell
his patient that she was dying, and at the same time told them to take
away from her bedside all such alarming books as the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> and the <i>Saint&rsquo;s Rest</i>, and to read to her a
reassuring chapter out of <i>Old Mortality</i> and <i>Pickwick</i>.</p>
<p>It will, no doubt, put the best-prepared of us into a deep muse,
as it put Standfast, when we are first told that we must at once prepare
ourselves for a change of life.&nbsp; But I for one would not for worlds
miss that solemn warning, and that last musing-time.&nbsp; It will all
be just as my Master pleases; but if it is within His will I shall till
then continue to petition Him that I may have a passage over the river
like the passage of Standfast.&nbsp; Or, if that may not now be, then,
at least, a musing-time like his.&nbsp; The post from the Celestial
City brought Mr. Standfast&rsquo;s summons &ldquo;open&rdquo; in his
hand.&nbsp; And thus it was that Standfast&rsquo;s translation did not
take him by surprise.&nbsp; Standfast was not plunged suddenly and without
warning into the terrible river.&nbsp; He took the open summons into
big own hand and read it out like a man.&nbsp; After which he went,
as his manner was, for a good while into a deep and undisturbed muse.&nbsp;
As soon as he came out of his muse he would have Greatheart to be sent
for.&nbsp; And then their last conversation together proceeded.&nbsp;
And no one interfered with the two brave-hearted men.&nbsp; No one interposed,
or said that Greatheart would exhaust or alarm Standfast, or would injuriously
hasten his end.&nbsp; Not only so, but all the way till he was half
over the river, Standfast kept up his own side of the noble conversation.&nbsp;
And it is his side of that half-earthly, whole-heavenly conversation
that I would like to have put into suitable type and scattered broadcast
over all our sick-beds.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; says Valdes to Julia in his <i>Christian
Alphabet</i>, &ldquo;have you ever crossed a deep river by a ford?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Julia, &ldquo;I have, many times.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And have you remarked how that by looking upon the water it seemed
as though your head swam, so that, if you had not assisted yourself,
either by closing your eyes, or by fixing them on the opposite shore,
you would have fallen into the water in great danger of drowning?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I have noticed that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And have you seen
how by keeping always for your object the view of the land that lies
on the other side, you have not felt that swimming of the head, and
so have suffered no danger of drowning?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have noticed
that too,&rdquo; replied Julia.&nbsp; Now, it was exactly this same
way of looking, not at the black and swirling river, but at the angelic
conduct waiting for him at the further bank, and then at the open gate
of the Celestial City,&mdash;it was this that kept Standfast&rsquo;s
head so steady and his heart like a glowing coal while he stood and
talked in the middle of the giddy stream.&nbsp; You would have thought
it was Paul himself talking to himself on the road to Assos.&nbsp; For
I defy even the apostle himself to have talked better or more boldly
to himself even on the solid midday road than Standfast talked to himself
in the bridgeless river.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see myself,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;at the end of my journey now.&nbsp; My toilsome days are all
ended.&nbsp; I am going now to see that head that was crowned with thorns,
and that face that was spat upon for me.&nbsp; I loved to hear my Lord
spoken of, and wherever I have seen the print of His shoe in the earth
I have coveted to set my foot also.&nbsp; His name has been to me as
a civet-box; yea, sweeter than all perfumes.&nbsp; His word I did use
to gather for my food, and for antidotes against my faintings.&nbsp;
He has held me, and I have kept me from my iniquities.&nbsp; Yea, my
steps He has strengthened in my way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, while Standfast
was thus in discourse his countenance changed, his strong man bowed
down under him, and after he had said &ldquo;Take me!&rdquo; he ceased
to be seen of them.&nbsp; But how glorious it was to see how the open
region was now filled with horses and chariots, with trumpeters and
pipers, and with singers and players on stringed instruments, all to
welcome the pilgrims as they went up and followed one another in at
the beautiful gate of the city!</p>
<h2>MADAM BUBBLE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Solomon</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have overcome the world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.&nbsp;
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.&nbsp;
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bubble world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Quarles</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madam Bubble&rsquo;s portrait was first painted by the Preacher.&nbsp;
And he painted her portrait with extraordinary insight, boldness, and
truthfulness.&nbsp; There is that in the Preacher&rsquo;s portrait of
Madam Bubble which only comes of the artist having mixed his colours,
as Milman says that Tacitus mixed his ink, with resentment and with
remorse.&nbsp; Out of His reading of Solomon and Moses and the Prophets
on this same subject, as well as out of His own observation and experience,
conflict and conquest, our Lord added some strong and deep and inward
touches of His own to that well-known picture, and then named it by
the New Testament name of the World.&nbsp; And then, after Him, His
longest-lived disciple set forth the same mother and her three daughters
under the three names that still stick to them to this day,&mdash;the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.&nbsp;
But it was reserved for John Bunyan to fill up and to finish those outlines
of Scripture and to pour over the whole work his own depth and strength
of colour, till, altogether, Madam Bubble stands out as yet another
masterpiece of our dreamer&rsquo;s astonishing genius.&nbsp; Let us
take our stand before this heaving canvas, then, till we have taken
attentive note of some of John Bunyan&rsquo;s inimitable touches and
strokes and triumphs of truth and art.&nbsp; &ldquo;One in very pleasant
attire, but old . . . This woman is a witch . . . I am the mistress
of the world, she said, and men are made happy by me . . . A tall, comely
dame, something of a swarthy complexion.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the newly discovered
portrait of a woman, by Albert D&uuml;rer, one of the marks of its genuineness
is the way that the great artist&rsquo;s initials A. D. are pencilled
in on the embroidery of the lady&rsquo;s bodice.&nbsp; And you will
note in this gentlewoman&rsquo;s open dress also how J. B. is inextricably
woven in.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wears a great purse by her side also, and
her hand is often in her purse fingering her money.&nbsp; Yea, this
is she that has bought off many a man from a pilgrim&rsquo;s life after
he had fairly begun it.&nbsp; She is a bold and an impudent slut also,
for she will talk with any man.&nbsp; If there be one cunning to make
money in any place, she will speak well of him from house to house .
. . She has given it out in some places also that she is a goddess,
and therefore some do actually worship her . . . She has her times and
open places of cheating, and she will say and avow it that none can
show a good comparable to hers.&nbsp; And thus she has brought many
to the halter, and ten thousand times more to hell.&nbsp; None can tell
of the mischief that she does.&nbsp; She makes variance betwixt rulers
and subjects, betwixt parents and children, &rsquo;twixt neighbour and
neighbour, &rsquo;twixt a man and his wife, &rsquo;twixt a man and himself,
&rsquo;twixt the flesh and the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on in the
great original.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had she stood by all this while,&rdquo;
said Standfast, whose eyes were still full of her, &ldquo;you could
not have set Madam Bubble more amply before me, nor have better described
her features.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that drew her picture was a good
limner,&rdquo; said Mr. Honest, &ldquo;and he that so wrote of her said
true&rdquo;.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the mistress of this world,&rdquo; says Madam
Bubble.&nbsp; And though all the time she is a bold and impudent slut,
yet it is the simple truth that she does sit as a queen over this world
and over the men of this world.&nbsp; For Madam Bubble has a royal family
like all other sovereigns.&nbsp; She has a court of her own, too, with
its ball-room presentations and its birthday honours.&nbsp; She has
a cabinet council also, and a bar and a bench with their pleadings and
their decisions.&nbsp; Far more than all that, she has a church which
she has established and of which she is the head; and a faith also of
which she is the defender.&nbsp; She has a standing army also for the
extension and the protection of her dominions.&nbsp; She levies taxes,
too, and sends out ambassadors, and makes treaties, and forms offensive
and defensive alliances.&nbsp; But what a bubble all this World is to
him whose eyes have at last been opened to see the hollowness and the
heartlessness of it all!&nbsp; For all its pursuits and all its possessions,
from a child&rsquo;s rattle to a king&rsquo;s sceptre, all is one great
bubble.&nbsp; Wealth, fame, place, power; art, science, letters; politics,
churches, sacraments, and scriptures&mdash;all are so many bubbles in
Madam Bubble&rsquo;s World.&nbsp; This wicked enchantress, if she does
not find all these things bubbles already, by one touch of her evil
wand she makes them so.&nbsp; She turns gold into dross, God into an
idle name, and His Word into words only; unless when in her malice she
turns it into a fruitful ground of debate and contention; a ground of
malice and hatred and ill-will.&nbsp; Vanity of vanities; all is vanity
and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; Still, she sits a queen and a goddess
to a great multitude: to all men, to begin with.&nbsp; And, like a goddess,
she sheds abroad her spirit in her people&rsquo;s hearts and lifts up
upon them for a time the light of her countenance.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the mistress of the world,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;and men are made happy by me.&rdquo;&mdash;I would like to see
one of them.&nbsp; I have seen many men to whom Madam Bubble had said
that if they would be ruled by her she would make them great and happy.&nbsp;
But though I have seen not a few who have believed her and let themselves
be ruled by her, I have never yet seen one happy man among them.&mdash;The
truth is, Madam Bubble is not able to make men happy even if she wished
to do it.&nbsp; She is not happy herself, and she cannot dispense to
others what she does not possess.&nbsp; And, yet, such are her sorceries
that, while her old dupes die in thousands every day, new dupes are
born to her every day in still greater numbers.&nbsp; New dupes who
run to the same excess of folly with her that their fathers ran; new
dupes led in the same mad dance after Madam Bubble and her three daughters.&nbsp;
But, always, and to all men, what a bubble both the mother and all her
daughters are!&nbsp; How they all make promises like their lying mother,
and how, like her, they all lead men, if not to the halter and to hell,
as Greatheart said, yet to a life of vanity and to a death of disappointment
and despair!&nbsp; What bubbles of empty hopes both she and her three
children blow up in the brains of men!&nbsp; What pictures of untold
happiness they paint in the imaginations of men!&nbsp; What pleasures,
what successes in life, what honours and what rewards she pledges herself
to see bestowed!&nbsp; &ldquo;She has her times and open places of cheating,&rdquo;
said one who knew her and all her ways well.&nbsp; And when men and
women are still young and inexperienced, that is one of her great cheating
times.&nbsp; At some seasons of the year, and in some waters, to the
fisherman&rsquo;s surprise and confusion, the fish will sometimes take
his bare hook; a bit of a red rag is a deadly bait.&nbsp; And Madam
Bubble&rsquo;s poorest and most perfunctory busking is quite enough
for the foolish fish she angles for.&nbsp; And not in our salad days
only, when we are still green in judgment, but even to grey hairs, this
wicked witch continues to entrap us to our ruin.&nbsp; Love, in all
its phases and in all its mixtures, first deludes the very young; and
then place, and power, and fame, and money are the bait she busks for
the middle-aged and the old; and always with the same bubble end.&nbsp;
The whole truth is that without God, the living and ever-present God,
in all ages of it and in all parts and experiences of it, our human
life is one huge bubble.&nbsp; A far-shining, high-soaring bubble; but
sooner or later seen and tasted to be a bubble&mdash;a deceit-filled,
poison-filled bubble.&mdash;Happy by her!&nbsp; All men happy by her!&nbsp;
The impudent slut!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Another thing about this slut is this, that &ldquo;she will
talk with any man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She makes up to us and makes eyes at
us just as if we were free to accept and return her three offers.&nbsp;
And still she talks to us and offers us the same things she offered
to Standfast till, to escape her and her offers, he betook himself to
his knees.&nbsp; Nay, truth to tell, after she had deceived us and ensnared
us till we lay in her net cursing both her and ourselves, so bold and
so impudent and so persistent is this temptress slut, and such fools
and idiots are we, that we soon lay our eyes on her painted beauty again
and our heads in her loathsome lap; our heads on that block over which
the axe hangs by an angry hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will talk with any
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt; but, then, it takes two to make a talk,
and the sad thing is that there are few men among us so wise, so steadfast,
and so experienced in her ways that they will not on occasion let Madam
Bubble talk her talk to them, and talk back again to her.&nbsp; The
oldest saint, the oftenest sold and most dearly redeemed sinner, needs
to suspect himself to the end, till he is clear out of Madam Bubble&rsquo;s
enchanted ground and for ever over that river of deliverance which shall
sweep Madam Bubble and all her daughters into the dead sea for ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The grey-haired saint may fail at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The surest guide a wanderer prove;<br />
Death only binds us fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bright shore of love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;She highly commends the rich,&rdquo; the guide goes
on about Madam Bubble, &ldquo;and if there be one cunning to get money
in any place she will speak well of him from house to house.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; says Faber, &ldquo;is not altogether matter,
nor yet altogether spirit.&nbsp; It is not man only, nor Satan only,
nor is it exactly sin.&nbsp; It is an infection, an inspiration, an
atmosphere, a life, a colouring matter, a pageantry, a fashion, a taste,
a witchery.&nbsp; None of all these names suit it, and all of them suit
it.&nbsp; Meanwhile its power over the human creation is terrific, its
presence ubiquitous, its deceitfulness incredible.&nbsp; It can find
a home under every heart beneath the poles.&nbsp; It is wider than the
catholic church, and it is masterful, lawless, and intrusive within
it.&nbsp; We are all living in it, breathing it, acting under its influence,
being cheated by its appearances, and unwarily admitting its principles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let young ministers who wish to preach to their people on the World&mdash;after
studying what the Preacher, and the Saviour, and John, and John Bunyan
say about the World,&mdash;still read Faber&rsquo;s powerful chapter
in his <i>Creator and Creature</i>.&nbsp; Yes; Madam Bubble finds a
home for herself in every heart beneath the poles.&nbsp; The truth is
Madam Bubble has no home, as she has no existence, but in human hearts.&nbsp;
And all that Solomon, and our Saviour, and John, and John Bunyan, and
Frederick Faber say about the world and about Madam Bubble they really
say about the heart of man.&nbsp; It is we, you and I, my brethren,
who so highly commend the rich.&nbsp; It is we ourselves here who speak
well from house to house of him whose father or whose self has been
cunning to get money.&nbsp; We either speak well or ill of them.&nbsp;
We either are sick with envy at them, or we fawn upon them and fall
down before them.&nbsp; How men rise in our esteem in the degree that
their money increases!&nbsp; With what reverence and holy awe we look
up at them as if they were gods and the sons of gods!&nbsp; They become
more than mortal men to our reverent imaginations.&nbsp; How happy,
how all but blessed they must be! we say to ourselves.&nbsp; Within
those park gates, under those high towers, in that silver-mounted carriage,
surrounded with all those liveried servants, and loved and honoured
by all those arriving and leaving guests&mdash;what happiness that rich
man must have!&nbsp; We are either eaten up of lean-eyed envy of this
and that rich man, or we positively worship them as other men worship
God and His saints.&nbsp; Yes; Madam Bubble is our very mother.&nbsp;
She conceived us and she suckled us.&nbsp; We were brought up in her
nurture and admonition.&nbsp; We learned her Catechism, and her shrine
is in our heart to-night.&nbsp; Like her, if only a pilgrim is poor,
we scorn him.&nbsp; We will not know him.&nbsp; But if there be any
one, pilgrim or no, cunning to get money, we honour him, and we claim
him as our kindred and relation, our acquaintance and our friend.&nbsp;
We will speak often of him as such from house to house.&nbsp; Just see
if we will not.&nbsp; There is room in our hearts, Madam Bubble, there
is room in our hearts for thee!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &ldquo;She loves them most that think best of her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But, surely, surely, the guide goes quite too far in blaming and being
hard upon poor Madam Bubble for that?&nbsp; For, to give her fair play,
she is not at all alone in that.&nbsp; Is the guide himself wholly above
that?&nbsp; Do we not all do that?&nbsp; Is there one in ten, is there
one in a thousand, who hates and humiliates himself because his love
of men and women goes up or down just as they think of him?&nbsp; Yes;
Greatheart is true to his great name in his whole portrait of Madam
Bubble also, and nowhere more true than in this present feature.&nbsp;
For when any man comes to have any true greatness in his heart&mdash;how
he despises and detests himself as he finds himself out in not only
claiming kindred and acquaintance with the rich and despising and denying
the poor; but, still more, in loving or hating other men just as they
love or hate him!&nbsp; The world loves her own.&nbsp; Yes; but he who
has been taken out of the world, and who has had the world taken out
of him, he loves&mdash;he strives to love, he goes to his knees every
day he lives to love&mdash;those who not only do not think well of him,
but who both think ill of him and speak ill of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Humility,&rdquo;
says William Law, &ldquo;does not consist in having a worse opinion
of ourselves than we deserve, or in abasing ourselves lower than we
really are.&nbsp; But as all virtue is founded in truth, so humility
is founded in a true and just sense of our weakness, misery, and sin.&nbsp;
He who rightly feels and lives in this sense of his condition lives
in humility.&nbsp; And, it may be added, when our hearts are wholly
clothed with humility we shall be prompt to approve the judgment and
to endorse the sentence of those who think and speak the least good
of us and the most evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas she,&rdquo; so the guide at last wound
up, &ldquo;that set Absalom against his father, and Jeroboam against
his master.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas she that persuaded Judas to sell his Lord,
and that prevailed with Demas to forsake the godly pilgrim&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
None can tell all the mischief that Madam Bubble does.&nbsp; She makes
variance between rulers and subjects, between parents and children,
&rsquo;twixt neighbour and neighbour, &rsquo;twixt a man and his wife,
&rsquo;twixt a man and himself, &rsquo;twixt the flesh and the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, I shall leave that last indictment and its lessons and its applications
to yourselves, my brethren.&nbsp; You will get far more good out of
this accumulated count against Madam Bubble if you explain it, and open
it up, and prove it, and illustrate it to yourselves.&nbsp; Explain,
then, in what way this sorceress set Absalom against his father and
Jeroboam against his master.&nbsp; Point out in what way she makes variance
between a ruler and his subjects, and give illustrations.&nbsp; Put
your finger on a parent and on a child between whom there is variance
at this moment on her account.&nbsp; And, if you are that parent or
that child, what have you done to remove that variance?&nbsp; Name two
neighbours that to your knowledge Madam Bubble has come between; and
say what you have done to be a peacemaker there.&nbsp; Set down what
you would say to a man and his wife so as to put them on their guard
against Madam Bubble ever coming in between them.&nbsp; And, last and
best of all, point out to yourself at what times and in what ways this
wicked witch tries to make variance between God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit
striving within you and your own evil heart still strong within you.&nbsp;
When you are weary and sleepy and hungry as a howlet, and, Madam Bubble
and her three daughters make a ring round you, what do you do?&nbsp;
Do you ever take to your knees?&nbsp; Really and honestly, do you?&nbsp;
When you find yourself out looking with holy fear on a rich and lofty
relation, and with insufferable contempt on a poor and intrusive relation,
by what name do you call yourself?&nbsp; Write it down.&nbsp; And when
she would fain put variance between you and those who do not think well
of you, what steps do you take to foil her?&nbsp; Where and how do you
get strength at that supreme moment to think of others as you would
have them think of you?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Standfast, &ldquo;what
a mercy it is that I did resist her! for to what might she not have
drawn me?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>GAIUS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gaius, mine host.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goodman Gaius was the head of a hostel that stood on the side of
the highway well on to the Celestial City.&nbsp; The hostess of the
hostel was no more, and the old hostel-keeper did all her once well-done
work and his own proper work into the bargain.&nbsp; Every day he inspected
the whole house with his own eyes, down even to the kitchen and the
scullery.&nbsp; The good woman had left our host an only daughter; but,
&ldquo;Keep her as much out of sight as is possible,&rdquo; she said,
and so fell asleep.&nbsp; And Gaius remembered his wife&rsquo;s last
testament every day, till none of the hostel customers knew that there
was so much as a young hostess in all the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, gentlemen,&rdquo;
replied the old innkeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, come in.&nbsp; It is late,
but I take you for true men, for you must know that my house is kept
open only for such.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he took the large pilgrim party
to their several apartments with his own eyes, and then set about a
supper for those so late arrivals.&nbsp; Stamping with his foot, he
brought up the cook with the euphonious and eupeptic name, and that
quick-witted domestic soon had a supper on the table that would have
made a full man&rsquo;s mouth water.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sight of all this,&rdquo;
said Matthew, as the under-cook laid the cloth and the trenchers, and
set the salt and the bread in order&mdash;&ldquo;the sight of this cloth
and of this forerunner of a supper begetteth in me a greater appetite
to my food than I thought I had before.&rdquo;&nbsp; So supper came
up; and first a heave-shoulder and a wave-breast were set on the table
before them, in order to show that they must begin their meal with prayer
and praise to God.&nbsp; These two dishes were very fresh and good,
and all the travellers did eat heartily well thereof.&nbsp; The next
was a bottle of wine red as blood.&nbsp; So Gaius said to them, &ldquo;Drink
freely; this is the juice of the true vine that makes glad the heart
of God and man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they did drink and were very merry.&nbsp;
The next was a dish of milk well crumbed.&nbsp; At the sight of which
Gaius said, &ldquo;Let the boys have that, that they may grow thereby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so on, dish after dish, till the nuts came with the recitations
and the riddles and the saws and the stories over the nuts.&nbsp; Thus
the happy party sat talking till the break of day.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, it is natural to remark that the first thing about
a host is his hospitality.&nbsp; And that, too, whether our host is
but the head of a hostel like Goodman Gaius, or the head of a well-appointed
private house like Gaius&rsquo;s neighbour, Mr. Mnason.&nbsp; The first
and the last thing about a host is his hospitality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say
little and do much&rdquo; is the example and the injunction to all our
housekeepers that Rabban Shammai draws out of the eighteenth of Genesis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be like your father Abraham,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;on the plains
of Mamre, who only promised bread and water, but straightway set Sarah
to knead three measures of her finest meal, while he ran to the herd
and fetched a calf tender and good, and stood by the three men while
they did eat butter and milk under the tree.&nbsp; Make thy Thorah an
ordinance: say little and do much: and receive every man with a pleasant
expression of countenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, this was exactly what Gaius
our goodman did that night, with one exception, which we shall be constrained
to attend to afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is late,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so
we cannot conveniently go out to seek food; but such as we have you
shall be welcome to, if that will content.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same
time Taste-that-which-is-good soon had a supper sent up to the table
fit for a prince: a supper of six courses at that time in the morning,
so that the sun was already in the sky when Old Honest closed his casement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dining in company is a divine institution,&rdquo; says Mr.
Edward White, in his delightful <i>Minor Moralities of Life</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let Soyer&rsquo;s art be honoured among all men,&rdquo; he goes
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cookery distinguishes mankind from the beasts that
perish.&nbsp; Happy is the woman whose daily table is the result of
forethought.&nbsp; Her husband shall rise up and call her blessed.&nbsp;
It is piteous when the culinary art is neglected in our young women&rsquo;s
education.&nbsp; Let them, as St. Peter says, imitate Sarah.&nbsp; Let
them see how that venerable princess went quickly to her kneading-trough
and oven and prepared an extempore collation of cakes and pilau for
the angels.&nbsp; How few ladies, whether Gentiles or Jewesses, could
do the like in the present day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The wistful and punctilious attention that Goodman Gaius
paid to each individual guest of his was a fine feature in his munificent
hospitality.&nbsp; He made every one who crossed his doorstep, down
even to Mr. Fearing, feel at once at home, such was his exquisite as
well as his munificent hospitality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he
said, clapping that white-faced and trembling pilgrim on the shoulder,
&ldquo;come, sir, be of good cheer, you are welcome to me and to my
house; and what thou hast a mind to, that call for freely: for what
thou wouldst have my servants will do for thee, and they will do it
for thee with a ready mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the same, for a long time
Mr. Fearing was mortally afraid of the servants.&nbsp; He would as soon
have thought of stamping his foot for a duchess to come up as for any
of Gaius&rsquo;s serving-maids.&nbsp; He was afraid to make any noise
in his room lest all the house should hear it.&nbsp; He was afraid to
touch anything in the room lest it should fall and be broken.&nbsp;
We ourselves, with all our assumed ease and elaborate abandon, are often
afraid to ring our bell even in an inn.&nbsp; Mr. Fearing would as soon
have pulled the tail of a rattlesnake.&nbsp; But before their sojourn
was over, the Guide was amazed at Mr. Fearing, for that hare-hearted
pilgrim would be doing things in the house that he himself would scarcely
do who had been in the house a thousand times.&nbsp; It was Gaius&rsquo;s
exuberant heartiness that had demoralised Mr. Fearing and made him almost
too forward even for a wayside inn.&nbsp; In little things also Gaius,
mine host, showed his sensitive and solicitous hospitality.&nbsp; We
all know housekeepers, not to say innkeepers, and not otherwise ungenerous
housekeepers either who will grudge us a sixpennyworth of sticks and
coals in a cold night, and that, too, in a room furnished to overflowing
by Morton Brothers or the Messrs. Maple.&nbsp; We take a candlestick
and a dozen candles with us in the boot of the carriage when we wish
to read or write late into the night in that great house.&nbsp; Another
housekeeper, who would give you her only daughter with her wealthy dowry,
will sometimes be seen by all in her house to grudge you a fresh cup
of afternoon tea when you drop in to see her and her daughter.&nbsp;
She says to herself that it is to spare the servants the stairs; but,
all the time, under the stairs, the servants are blushing for the sometimes
unaccountable stinginess of their unusually munificent mistress.&nbsp;
I shall give you &ldquo;line upon line, precept upon precept, here a
little and there a little&rdquo; of Aristotle upon munificence in little
things till you come up to his pagan standard.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
a real greatness,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;even in the way that some men
will buy a toy to a child.&nbsp; Even in the smallest matters the munificent
man will act munificently!&rdquo;&nbsp; As Gaius, mine host, munificently
did.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Speaking of children, what a night of entertainment good
old Gaius gave the children of the pilgrim party!&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the
boys have the crumbed milk,&rdquo; he gave orders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Butter
and honey shall they eat,&rdquo; he exclaimed over them as that brimming
dish came up.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was our Lord&rsquo;s dish when He was
a child,&rdquo; he said to the mother of the boys, &ldquo;that He might
know to refuse the evil and to choose the good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they
brought up a dish of apples, and they were very good-tasted fruit.&nbsp;
Then said Matthew, &ldquo;May we eat apples, since they were such by
and with which the serpent beguiled our first mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
said Gaius,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Apples were they by which we were beguiled,<br />
Yet sin, not apples, hath our souls defiled.<br />
Apples forbid, if eat, corrupt the blood.<br />
To eat such, when commanded, does us good.<br />
Drink of His flagons then, thou Church, His Dove,<br />
And eat His apples who are sick of love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then said Matthew, &ldquo;I make the scruple because I awhile since
was sick with eating of fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Forbidden fruit,&rdquo;
said the host, &ldquo;will make you sick, but not what our Lord hath
tolerated.&rdquo;&nbsp; While they were thus talking they were presented
with another dish, and it was a dish of nuts.&nbsp; Then said some at
the table, &ldquo;Nuts spoil tender teeth, especially the teeth of children,&rdquo;
which when Gaius heard, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hard texts are nuts (I will not call them cheaters)<br />
Whose shells do keep their kernels from the eaters;<br />
Ope then the shells and you shall have the meat;<br />
They here are brought for you to crack and eat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Samuel whispered to his mother and said, &ldquo;Mother, this
is a very good man&rsquo;s house; let us stay here a good while before
we go any farther.&rdquo;&nbsp; The which Gaius the host overhearing,
said, &ldquo;With a very good will, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Widower as old Gaius was, and never for a single hour forgot
that he was, there was a certain sweet and stately gallantry awakened
in his withered old heart at the sight of Christiana and Mercy, and
especially at the sight of Matthew and Mercy when they were seen together.&nbsp;
He seems to have fallen almost in love with that aged matron, as he
called her, and the days of his youth came back to him as he studied
the young damsel, who was to her as a daughter.&nbsp; And this set the
loquacious old innkeeper upon that famous oration about women which
every man who has a mother, or a wife, or a sister, or a daughter has
by heart.&nbsp; And from that he went on to discourse on the great advantages
of an early marriage.&nbsp; He was not the man, nor was he speaking
to a mother who was the woman, ever to become a vulgar and coarse-minded
matchmaker; at the same time, he liked to see Matthew and Mercy sent
out on a message together, leaving it to nature and to grace to do the
rest.&nbsp; The pros and cons of early marriage were often up at his
hearty table, but he always debated, and Gaius was a great debater,
that true hospitality largely consisted in throwing open the family
circle to let young people get well acquainted with one another in its
peace and sweetness.&nbsp; And Gaius both practised what he preached,
and at the same time endorsed his watchful wife&rsquo;s last testament,
when he gave his daughter Phebe to James, Christiana&rsquo;s second
son, and thus was left alone, poor old Gaius, when the happy honeymoon
party started upward from his hostel door.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Their next host was one Mr. Mnason, a Cyprusian by nation,
and an old disciple.&nbsp; &ldquo;How far have you come to-day?&rdquo;
he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the house of Gaius our friend,&rdquo; they
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have gone
a good stitch; you may well be weary; sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they
sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our great want a while since,&rdquo; said Old
Honest, &ldquo;was harbour and good company, and now I hope we have
both.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For harbour,&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;you
see what it is, but for good company that will appear in the trial.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After they were a little rested Old Honest again asked his host if there
were any store of good people in that town; and, &ldquo;How,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;shall we do to see some of them?&nbsp; For the sight
of good men to them that are going on pilgrimage is like to the appearing
of the moon and stars to them that are sailing upon the seas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then Mr. Mnason stamped with his foot and his daughter Grace came up,
when he sent her out for five of his friends in the town, saying that
he had a guest or two in his house at present to whom he would like
to introduce them.</p>
<p>Now, this is another of the good qualities of a good host, to know
the best and the most suitable people in the town, and to be on such
terms with them that on short notice they will step across to help to
entertain such travellers as had come to Mr. Mnason&rsquo;s table.&nbsp;
And it is an excellent thing to be sure that when we are so invited
we shall not only get a good dinner, but also, as good &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;
with our dinner, good company and good conversation.&nbsp; It is nothing
short of a fine art to gather together and to seat suitably beside one
another good and suitable people as Mr. and Miss Mnason did in their
hospitable house that afternoon.&nbsp; And then, as to the talk: let
the host and the hostess introduce the guests, and then let the guests
introduce their own topics.&nbsp; And as far as possible, in a city
and a day like this, let our topics be books rather than people.&nbsp;
And let the books be the books that the guests have read rather than
those that the host and the hostess have read.&nbsp; Books are a fine
subject for a talk at table.&nbsp; Only, let great readers order their
learned and literary talk so as not to lead the less learned into temptation.&nbsp;
There is no finer exercise of fine feeling than to be able to carry
on a conversation about matters that other people present are ignorant
of, and at the same time to interest them, to set them at ease, and
to make them forget both you and themselves.&nbsp; I had a letter the
other day from an English Church clergyman, in which he tells me that
his bishop is coming this month to his vicarage for a kind of visitation
and retreat, and that they are to have William Law&rsquo;s <i>Characters
and Characteristics</i> read aloud to them when the bishop and the assembled
clergy are at their meals.&nbsp; For my part, I would rather hear a
good all-round talk on that book by the bishop and his clergy after
they had all read the book over and over again at home.&nbsp; But such
readings at assembled meals have all along been a feature of the best
fraternal life in the Church of England and in some of the sister churches.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Now, after dining and supping repeatedly with garrulous
old Gaius, and with the all-but-silent Mr. Mnason, I have come home
ruminating again and again on this&mdash;that a good host, the best
host, lets his guests talk while he attends to the table.&nbsp; If the
truth may even be whispered to one&rsquo;s-self about a table that one
has just left, Gaius did his best to spoil his good supper by his own
over-garrulity.&nbsp; It was good talk that he entertained his waiting
guests with, but we may have too much of a good thing.&nbsp; His oration
in praise of women was an excellent oration, had it been delivered in
another house than his own; and, say, when he was asked to give the
health of Christiana, or of Matthew the bridegroom and Mercy the bride,
it would then have been perfect; but not in his own house, and not when
his guests were waiting for their supper.&nbsp; On the other hand, you
should have seen that perfect gentleman, Mr. Mnason.&nbsp; For that
true old Christian and old English gentleman never once opened his mouth
after he had set his guests a-talking.&nbsp; He was too busy watching
when any man&rsquo;s dish was again empty.&nbsp; He was too much delighted
to see that every one of his guests was having his punctual share of
the supper, and at the same time his full share of the talk.&nbsp; Mr.
Fearing&rsquo;s small voice was far more pleasant to Mr. Mnason than
his own voice was in his own best story.&nbsp; As I opened my own door
the other night after supping with Mr. and Miss Mnason, I said to myself&mdash;One
thing I have again seen and learned to-night, and that is, that a host,
and still more a hostess, should talk less at their own table than their
most silent, most bashful, and most backward guest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make
this an ordinance for thee,&rdquo; said Rabban Shammai to his sons in
the law; &ldquo;receive all thy guests with a pleasant expression of
countenance, and then say little and do much.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHRISTIAN</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The disciples were called Christians first at
Antioch.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Luke</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>King
Agrippa</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the other personages in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress come and
go; they all ascend the stage for a longer or shorter time, and then
pass off the stage and so pass out of our sight; but Christian in the
First Part, and Christiana in the Second Part, are never for a single
moment out of our sight.&nbsp; And, accordingly, we have had repeated
occasion and opportunity to learn many excellent lessons from the chief
pilgrim&rsquo;s upward walk and heavenly conversation.&nbsp; But so
full and so rich are his life and his character, that some very important
things still remain to be collected before we finally close his history.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost,&rdquo; said our
Lord, after His miraculous meal of multiplied loaves and fishes with
His disciples.&nbsp; And in like manner I shall now proceed to gather
up some of the remaining fragments of Christian&rsquo;s life and character
and experience.&nbsp; And I shall collect these fragments into the three
baskets of his book, his burden, and his sealed roll and certificate.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; And first, a few things as to his book.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
I slept I dreamed, and behold I saw a man clothed in rags standing in
a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand,
and a great burden upon his back.&nbsp; I looked and saw him open the
book and read therein; and as he read he wept and trembled; and not
being able longer to contain he broke out with a lamentable cry, saying,
What shall I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; We hear a great deal in these advertising
days, and not one word too much, about the books that have influenced
and gone largely to the making of our great men; but Graceless, like
John Bunyan, his biographer, was a man of but one book.&nbsp; But, then,
that book was the most influential of all books; it was the Book of
books; it was God&rsquo;s very own and peculiar Book.&nbsp; And those
of us who, like this man, have passed out of a graceless into a gracious
state will for ever remember how that same Book at that time influenced
us till it made us what we are and shall yet be.&nbsp; We read many
other good books at that epoch in our life, but it was the pure Bible
that we read and prayed over out of sight the most.&nbsp; We needed
no commentators or exegetes on our simple Bible in those days.&nbsp;
The great texts stood out to our eyes in those days as if they had been
written with a sunbeam; while all other books (and we read nothing but
the best books in those days) looked like twilight and rushlight beside
our Bible.&nbsp; In those immediate, direct, and intense days we would
have satisfied Wordsworth and Matthew Arnold themselves in the way we
read our Bible with our eye never off the object.&nbsp; The Four Last
Things were ever before us&mdash;death and judgment, heaven and hell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O my dear wife,&rdquo; said Graceless, &ldquo;and you the children
of my bowels, I your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a
burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed
that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven, in which fearful
overthrow both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall
miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of
escape can be found whereby we may be delivered.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would
walk also solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading and sometimes
praying; and thus for some days he spent his time.&nbsp; Graceless at
that time and at that stage would have satisfied the exigent author
of the <i>Practical Treatise upon Christian Perfection</i> where he
says that &ldquo;we are too apt also to think that we have sufficiently
read a book when we have so read it as to know what it contains.&nbsp;
This reading may be quite sufficient as to many books; but as to the
Bible we are not to think that we have read it enough because we have
often read and heard what it teaches.&nbsp; We must read our Bible,
not to know what it contains, but to fill our hearts with the spirit
of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, again, and on this same point, &ldquo;There
is this unerring key to the right use of the Bible.&nbsp; The Bible
has only one intent, and that is to make a man know, resist, and abhor
the working of his fallen earthly nature, and to turn the faith, hope,
and longing desire of his heart to God; and therefore we are only to
read our Bibles with this view and to learn this one lesson from it
. . . The critic looks into his books to see how Latin and Greek authors
have used the words &lsquo;stranger&rsquo; and &lsquo;pilgrim,&rsquo;
but the Christian, who knows that man lives in labour and toil, in sickness
and pain, in hunger and thirst, in heat and cold among the beasts of
the field, where evil spirits like roaring lions seek to devour him&mdash;he
only knows in what truth and reality man is a poor stranger and a distressed
pilgrim upon the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Bunyan read neither Plato
nor Aristotle, but he read David and Paul till he was the chief of sinners,
and till he was first the Graceless and then the Christian of his own
next-to-the-Bible book.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the second place, and as to his burden.&nbsp; We are
supplied with no particulars as to the first beginnings, the gradual
make-up, and at last the terrible size of Christian&rsquo;s burden.&nbsp;
What this pilgrim&rsquo;s youthful life must have been in such a city
as his native city was, and while he was still a young man of such a
name and such a character in such a city, we are left to ourselves to
think and consider.&nbsp; Graceless was his name by nature, and his
life was as his name and his nature were.&nbsp; Still, as I have said,
we have no detailed and particular account of his early life when his
burden was still day and night in the making up.&nbsp; How long into
your life were you graceless, my brother?&nbsp; And what kind of life
did you lead day and night before you were persuaded or alarmed, as
the case may have been with you, into being a Christian?&nbsp; What
burdens do you carry on your broken back to this day that were made
up in the daylight or in the darkness by your own hands in your early
days?&nbsp; Were you early or were you too late in your conversion?&nbsp;
Or are you truly converted to God and to salvation even yet?&nbsp; And
are you at this moment still binding a burden on your back that you
shall never lay down on this side your grave&mdash;it may be, not on
this side your burning bed in hell?&nbsp; Ask yourselves all that before
God and before your own conscience, and make yourselves absolutely sure
that God at any rate is not mocked; and, therefore that you, too, shall
in the end reap exactly as you from the beginning have sown.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
camest thou by thy burden at first?&rdquo; asked Mr. Worldly-Wiseman
at the trembling pilgrim.&nbsp; &ldquo;By reading this book in my hand,&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; And, in the long run, it is always the Bible that
best creates a sinner&rsquo;s burden, binds it on his back, and makes
it so terribly heavy to bear.&nbsp; Fear of death and judgment will
sometimes make up and bind on a sinner&rsquo;s burden; and sometimes
the fear of man&rsquo;s judgment on this side of death will do it.&nbsp;
Fear of being found out in some cases will make a man&rsquo;s secret
sin far too heavy for him to bear.&nbsp; The throne of public opinion
is not a very white throne; at the same time, it is a coarse forecast
and a rough foretaste of the last judgment; and the fear of it not seldom
makes a man&rsquo;s burden simply intolerable to him.&nbsp; Sometimes
a great sinner&rsquo;s burden leads him to flight and outlawry; sometimes
to madness and self-murder; and sometimes, by the timeous and sufficient
grace of God, to the way of escape that our pilgrim took.&nbsp; Tenderness
of conscience, also, simple softness of heart and conscience, will sometimes
make a terrible burden out of what other men would call a very light
matter.&nbsp; Bind a burden on that iron pillar standing there, and
it will feel nothing and say nothing.&nbsp; But, bind the same burden
on that man in whose seat that dead pillar takes up a sitter&rsquo;s
room, and he will make all that are in the house hear his sighs and
his groans.&nbsp; And lay an act of sin&mdash;an evil word or evil work
or evil thought&mdash;on one man among us, and he will walk about the
streets with as erect a head and as smiling a countenance and as light
a step as if he were an innocent child; while, lay half as much on his
neighbour, and it will so bruise him to the earth that all men will
take knowledge of him that he is a miserable man.&nbsp; Our Lord could
no doubt have carried His cross from the hall of judgment to the hill-top
without help had His back not been wet with blood.&nbsp; What with a
whole and an unwealed body, a well-rested and well-nourished body, He
could easily have carried, with His broken body and broken heart He
quite sank under.&nbsp; And so it is with His people.&nbsp; One of His
heart-broken, heart-bleeding people will sink down to death and hell
under a burden of sin and corruption that another of them will scarcely
feel or know or believe that it is there.&nbsp; Some sins again in themselves,
and by reason of several aggravations, are far more heavy to bear than
others, and by some sinners than others.&nbsp; I was reading Bishop
Andrewes to myself last night and came upon this pertinent passage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sin: its measure, its harm, its scandal.&nbsp; Its quality: how
often&mdash;how long.&nbsp; The person by whom: his age, condition,
state, enlightenment.&nbsp; Its manner, motive, time, and place.&nbsp;
The folly of it, the ingratitude of it, the hardness of it, the presumptuousness
of it.&nbsp; By heart, by mouth, by deed.&nbsp; Against God, my neighbours,
my own body.&nbsp; By knowledge, by ignorance.&nbsp; Willingly and unwillingly.&nbsp;
Of old and of late.&nbsp; In boyhood and youth, in mature and old age.&nbsp;
Things done once, repeated often, hidden and open.&nbsp; Things done
in anger, and from the lust of the flesh and of the world.&nbsp; Before
and after my call.&nbsp; Asleep by night and awake by day.&nbsp; Things
remembered and things forgotten.&nbsp; Through the fiery darts of the
enemy, through the unclean desires of the flesh&mdash;I have sinned
against Thee.&nbsp; Have mercy on me, O God, and forgive me!&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is the way some men&rsquo;s burdens are made up to such gigantic
proportions and then bound on by such acute cords.&nbsp; That is the
way that Lancelot Andrewes and John Bunyan walked solitarily in the
fields, sometimes reading and sometimes praying, till the one of them
put himself into his immortal <i>Devotions</i>, and the other into his
immortal <i>Grace Abounding</i> and <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked the Gatekeeper
further if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his
back, for as yet he had not got rid of it, nor could he by any means
get it off without help.&nbsp; He told him, &lsquo;As to thy burden,
be content to bear it until thou comest to the place of deliverance,
for there it will fall from off thy back itself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now I
saw in my dream that the highway up which Christian was to go was fenced
on either side with a wall, and that wall is Salvation.&nbsp; Up this
way, therefore, did burdened Christian run, but not without great difficulty,
because of the load on his back.&nbsp; He ran thus till he came to a
place somewhat ascending, and upon that place stood a cross, and a little
below in the bottom a sepulchre.&nbsp; So I saw in my dream that just
as Christian came up with the cross his burden loosed from off his back,
and began to tumble and so continued to do till it came to the mouth
of the sepulchre, where it fell in and I saw it no more.&nbsp; Then
was Christian glad and lightsome, and said with a merry heart, &lsquo;He
hath given me rest by His sorrow, and life by His death!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blest Cross! blest Sepulchre!&nbsp; Blest rather
be<br />
The Man that there was put to shame for me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, then, how it could be that this so happy man was scarcely a
stone-cast past the cross when he had begun again to burden himself
with fresh sin, and thus to disinter all his former sin?&nbsp; How a
true pilgrim comes to have so many burdens to bear, and that till he
ceases to be any longer a pilgrim,&mdash;a burden of guilt, a burden
of corruption, and a burden of bare creaturehood,&mdash;I must leave
all that, and all the questions connected with all that, for you all
to think out and work out for yourselves; and you will not say any morning
on this earth, like Mrs. Timorous, that you have little to do.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The third of the three Shining Ones who saluted Christian
at the cross set a mark on his forehead, and put a roll with a seal
set upon it into his hand.&nbsp; A roll and a seal which he bid him
look on as he ran, and that he should give that roll in at the Celestial
Gate.&nbsp; Bunyan does not in all places come up to his usual clearness
in what he says about the sealed roll.&nbsp; We must believe that he
understood his own meaning and intention in all that he says, first
and last, about the roll, but he has not always made his meaning clear,
at least to one of his readers.&nbsp; Theological students, and, indeed,
all thoughtful Christian men, are invited to read Dr. Cunningham&rsquo;s
powerful paper on Assurance in his <i>Reformers</i>.&nbsp; The whole
literature of Assurance is there taken up and weighed and sifted with
all that great writer&rsquo;s incomparable learning and power and judgment.&nbsp;
Our Larger Catechism, also, is excellent on this subject; and this subject
is a favourite commonplace with all our best Calvinistic, Puritan, and
Evangelical authors.&nbsp; Let us take two or three passages out of
those authors just as a specimen, and so close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can true believers&rdquo;&mdash;Larger Catechism, Question
80&mdash;&ldquo;Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are
in an estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein to the
end?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>: Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavour
to walk in all good conscience before Him may, without extraordinary
revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God&rsquo;s promise,
and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces
to which the promises of eternal life are made, and bearing witness
with their spirits that they are the children of God, they may be infallibly
assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein
unto salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Question 81: &ldquo;Are all true believers
at all times assured of their present being in a state of grace, and
that they shall be saved?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>: Assurance of grace and
salvation not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait
long before they obtain it, and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have
it weakened and intermitted through manifold distempers, sins, temptations,
and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and
support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A Christian&rsquo;s assurance,&rdquo; says Fraser of Brea, &ldquo;though
it does not firstly flow from his holiness, yet is ever after proportionable
to his holy walking.&nbsp; Faith is kept in a pure conscience.&nbsp;
Sin is like a blot of ink fallen upon our evidence.&nbsp; This I found
to be a truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the speech of one to me,&rdquo;
says Thomas Shepard of New England, &ldquo;next to the donation of Christ,
no mercy like this, to deny assurance long; and why?&nbsp; For if the
Lord had not, I should have given way to a loose heart and life.&nbsp;
And this is a rule I have long held&mdash;long denial of assurance is
like fire to burn out some sin and then the Lord will speak peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Serve your God day and night faithfully,&rdquo; says Dr. Goodwin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Walk humbly; and there is a promise of the Holy Ghost to come
and fill your hearts with joy unspeakable and glorious to rear you up
to the day of redemption.&nbsp; Sue this promise out, wait for it, rest
not in believing only, rest not in assurance by graces only; there is
a further assurance to be had.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not give
a straw for that assurance,&rdquo; says John Newton, &ldquo;which sin
will not damp.&nbsp; If David had come from his adultery and still have
talked of his assurance, I should have despised his speech.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;When we want the faith of assurance,&rdquo; says Matthew Henry,
&ldquo;let us live by the faith of adherence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
the whole truth is in a nutshell in Isaiah and in John: &ldquo;The effect
of righteousness shall be quietness and assurance for ever,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue,
but in deed and in truth.&nbsp; And hereby we shall know that we are
of the truth, and so shall assure our hearts before Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHRISTIANA</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Honour widows that are widows indeed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know next to nothing of Christiana till after she is a widow indeed.&nbsp;
The names of her parents, and what kind of parents they were, the schools
and the boarding-schools to which they sent their daughter, her school
companions, the books she read, if she ever read any books at all, the
amusements she was indulged in and indulged herself in&mdash;on all
that her otherwise full and minute biographer is wholly silent.&nbsp;
He does not go back beyond her married life; he does not even go back
to the beginning of that.&nbsp; The only thing we are sure of about
Christiana&rsquo;s early days is that she was an utterly ungodly woman
and that she married an utterly ungodly man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you a
family?&nbsp; Are you a married man?&rdquo; asked Charity of Christian
in the House Beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a wife and four small children,&rdquo;
he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why did you not bring them along with you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then Christian wept, and said: &ldquo;Oh, how willingly would I have
done it; but they were all utterly averse to my going on pilgrimage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you should have talked to them,&rdquo; said Charity, &ldquo;and
have endeavoured to have shown them the danger of being behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; answered Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;And did you
pray to God that He would bless your counsel to them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
and with much affection; for you must think that my wife and poor children
were very dear unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But what could they say
for themselves why they came not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my wife was
afraid of losing the world, and my children were given over to the foolish
delights of youth; so what with one thing and what with another, they
left me to wander in this manner alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what her husband&rsquo;s conversion, good example, and most earnest
entreaties could not all do for his worldly wife, that his sudden death
speedily did.&nbsp; And thus it is that both Christiana&rsquo;s best
life, all our interest in her, and all our information about her, dates,
sad to say, not from her espousal, nor from her marriage day, nor from
any part of her married life, but from her husband&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
Her maidenhood has no interest for us; all our interest is fixed on
her widowhood.&nbsp; This work of fiction now in our hands begins where
all other works of fiction end; for in the life of religion, you must
know, our best is always before us.&nbsp; Well, scarcely was her husband
dead when Christiana began to accuse herself of having killed him.&nbsp;
To take her own bitter words for it, the most agonising and remorseful
thoughts about her conduct to her husband stung her heart like so many
wasps.&nbsp; Ah yes!&nbsp; A wasp&rsquo;s sting is but a blade of innocent
grass compared with the thoughts that have stung us all as we recalled
what we said and did to those who are now no more.&nbsp; There are graves
in the churchyard we dare not go near.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have sinned away
your father!&rdquo; she cried, as she threw herself on the earth at
the feet of her astounded children.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have sinned away
your father and he is gone!&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet there was no mark of
a bullet and no gash of a knife on his dead body, and no chemistry could
have extracted one grain of arsenic or of strychnine out of his blood.&nbsp;
But there are many ways of taking a man&rsquo;s life besides those of
poison or a knife or a gunshot.&nbsp; Constant fault-finding, constant
correction and studied contempt before strangers, total want of sympathy
and encouragement, gloomy looks, rough remarks, all blame and never
a word of praise, things like these between man and wife will kill as
silently and as surely as poison or suffocation.&nbsp; Look at home,
my brethren, and ask yourselves what you will think of much of your
present conduct when it has borne its proper fruit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon
this came into her mind by swarms all her unkind, unnatural, and ungodly
carriages to her dear friend, which also clogged her conscience and
did load her with guilt.&nbsp; It all returned upon her like a flash
of lightning, and rent the caul of her heart asunder.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That
which troubleth me most,&rdquo; she would cry out, &ldquo;is my churlish
carriages to him when he was under distress.&nbsp; I am that woman,&rdquo;
she would cry out and would not be appeased&mdash;&ldquo;I am that woman
that was so hardhearted as to slight my husband&rsquo;s troubles, and
that left him to go on his journey alone.&nbsp; How like a churl I carried
myself to him in all that!&nbsp; And so guilt took hold of my mind,&rdquo;
she said to the Interpreter, &ldquo;and would have drawn me to the pond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minister&rsquo;s widow once told me that she had gone home after
hearing a sermon of mine on the text, &ldquo;What profit is there in
my blood?&rdquo; and had destroyed a paper of poison she had purchased
in her despair on the previous Saturday night.&nbsp; It was not a sermon
from her unconscious minister, but it was far better; it was a conversation
that Christiana held with her four boys that fairly and for ever put
all thought of the pond out of their mother&rsquo;s remorseful mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So Christiana,&rdquo; as we read in the opening of her history&mdash;&ldquo;so
Christiana called her sons together and began thus to address herself
unto them: My sons, I have, as you may perceive, been of late under
much exercise in my soul about the death of your father.&nbsp; My carriages
to your father in his distress are a great load on my conscience.&nbsp;
Come, my children, let us pack up and be gone to the gate, that we may
see your father and be with him, according to the laws of that land.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I like that passage, I think, the best in all Christiana&rsquo;s delightful
history&mdash;that passage which begins with these words: &ldquo;So
she called her children together.&rdquo;&nbsp; For when she called her
children together she opened to them both her heart and her conscience;
and from that day there was but one heart and one conscience in all
that happy house.&nbsp; I was walking alone on a country road the other
day, and as I was walking I was thinking about my pastoral work and
about my people and their children, when all at once I met one of my
people.&nbsp; My second sentence to him was: &ldquo;This very moment
I was thinking about your sons.&nbsp; How are they getting on?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He quite well understood me.&nbsp; He knew that I was not indifferent
as to how they were getting on in business, but he knew that I was alluding
more to the life of godliness and virtue in their hearts and in their
characters.&nbsp; &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may give
your sons the skin off your back, but they will not give you their confidence!&rdquo;&nbsp;
So had it been with Christian and his sons.&nbsp; He had never managed,
even in his religion, to get into the confidence of his sons; but when
their mother took them into her agonised confidence, from that day she
was in all their confidences, good and bad.&nbsp; You who are in your
children&rsquo;s confidences will pray in secret for my lonely friend
with the skin off his back, will you not? that he may soon be able to
call his sons together so as to start together on a new life of family
love, and family trust, and family religion.&nbsp; That was a fine sight.&nbsp;
Who will make a picture of it?&nbsp; This widow indeed at the head of
her family council-table, and Matthew at the foot, and James and Joseph
and Samuel all in their places.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, my children, let
us pack up that we may see your father!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then did her children
burst into tears for joy that the heart of their mother was so inclined.</p>
<p>From that first family council let us pass on to Christiana&rsquo;s
last interview with her family and her other friends.&nbsp; Her biographer
introduces her triumphant translation with this happy comment on the
margin: &ldquo;How welcome is death to them that have nothing to do
but die!&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, that was exactly Christiana&rsquo;s case.&nbsp;
She had so packed up at the beginning of her journey; she had so got
and had so kept the confidences of all her sons; she had seen them all
so married in the Lord, and thus so settled in a life of godliness and
virtue; she had, in short, lived the life of a widow indeed, till, when
the post came for her, she had nothing left to do but just to rise up
and follow him.&nbsp; His token to her was an arrow with a point sharpened
with love, let easily into her heart, which by degrees wrought so effectually
with her that at the time appointed she must be gone.&nbsp; We have
read of arrows of death sharpened sometimes with steel and sometimes
with poison; but this arrow, shot from heaven, was sharpened to a point
with love.&nbsp; Indeed, that arrow, or the very fellow of it, had been
shot into Christiana&rsquo;s heart long ago when she stood at that spot
somewhat ascending where was a cross and a sepulchre; and, especially,
ever since the close of Greatheart&rsquo;s great discourse on pardon
by deed.&nbsp; For the hearing of that famous discourse had made her
exclaim: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Thou loving One, it makes my heart bleed to
think that Thou shouldest bleed for me!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Thou blessed
One, Thou deservest to have me, for Thou hast bought me!&nbsp; Thou
deservest to have me all, for Thou hast paid for me ten thousand times
more than I am worth!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it was with all that love working
effectually in her heart that Christiana called for her children to
give them her blessing.&nbsp; And what a comfort it was to her to see
them all around her with the mark of the kingdom on their foreheads,
and with their garments white.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sons and my daughters,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;be you all ready against the time His post calls for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she called for Mr. Valiant-for-truth, and entreated
him to have an eye on her children, and to speak comfortably to them
if at any time he saw them faint.&nbsp; And then she gave Mr. Standfast
her ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; she said, as Mr. Honest came in&mdash;&ldquo;Behold
an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Mr. Ready-to-halt
came in, and then Mr. Despondency and his daughter Much-afraid, and
then Mr. Feeble-mind.&nbsp; Now the day drew on that Christiana must
be gone.&nbsp; So the road was full of people to see her take her journey.&nbsp;
But, behold! all the banks beyond the river were full of horses and
chariots which were come down from above to accompany her to the City
gates, so she came forth and entered the river with a beckon of farewell
to those that followed her to the river-side.&nbsp; The last word she
was heard to say here was, &ldquo;I come, Lord, to be with Thee, and
to bless Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But with all this, you must not suppose that this good woman, this
mother in Israel, had forgotten her grandchildren.&nbsp; She would sooner
have forgotten her own children.&nbsp; But she was too good a woman
to forget either.&nbsp; For long ago, away back at the river on this
side the Delectable Mountains, she had said to her four daughters&mdash;I
must tell you exactly what she has said: &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;in this meadow there are cotes and folds for sheep, and an house
is built here also for the nourishing and bringing up of those lambs,
even the babes of those women that go on pilgrimage.&nbsp; Also there
is One here who can have compassion and that can gather these lambs
with His arm and carry them in His bosom.&nbsp; This Man, she said,
will house and harbour and succour the little ones, so that none of
them shall be lacking in time to come.&nbsp; This Man, if any of them
go astray or be lost, He will bring them again, He will bind up that
which was broken, and will strengthen them that are sick.&nbsp; So they
were content to commit their little ones to that Man, and all this was
to be at the charge of the King, and so it was as a hospital to young
children and orphans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I shall sum up my chief impressions of Christiana under the
three heads of her mind, her heart, and her widowhood indeed.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The mother of Christian&rsquo;s four sons was a woman of
real mind, as so many of the maidens, and wives, and widows of Puritan
England and Covenanting Scotland were.&nbsp; You gradually gather that
impression just from being beside her as the journey goes on.&nbsp;
She does not speak much; but, then, there is always something individual,
remarkable, and memorable in what she says.&nbsp; I have a notion of
my own that Christiana must have been a reader of that princely Puritan,
John Milton.&nbsp; And if that was so, that of itself would be certificate
enough as to her possession of mind.&nbsp; There is always a dignity
and a strength about her utterances that make us feel sure that she
had always had a mind far above her neighbours, Mrs. Bat&rsquo;s-eyes,
Mrs. Light-mind, and Mrs. Know-nothing.&nbsp; The first time she opens
her mouth in our hearing she lets fall an expression that Milton had
just made famous in his <i>Samson</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ease to the body some, none to the mind<br />
From restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm<br />
Of hornets armed no sooner found alone,<br />
But rush upon me thronging, and present<br />
Times past, what once I was, and what am now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor can I leave this point without asserting it to you that no church
and no school of theology has ever developed the mind as well as sanctified
the heart of the common people like the preaching of the Puritan pulpit.&nbsp;
Matthew Arnold was not likely to over-estimate the good that Puritanism
had done to England.&nbsp; Indeed, in his earlier writings he sometimes
went out of his way to lament the hurt that the Puritan spirit had done
to liberality of life and mind in his native land.&nbsp; But in his
riper years we find him saying: &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I
am not blind to the faults of the Puritan discipline, but it has been
an invaluable discipline for that poor, inattentive, and immoral creature,
man.&nbsp; And the more I read history and the more I see of mankind,
the more I recognise the value of the Puritan discipline.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in that same Address he &ldquo;founded his best hopes for that so
enviable and unbounded country in which he was speaking, America, on
the fact that so many of its millions had passed through the Puritan
discipline.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Milton was a product of that discipline
on the one hand, as John Bunyan was on the other.&nbsp; Christiana was
another of its products in the sphere of the family, just as Matthew
Arnold himself had some of his best qualities out of the same fruitful
school.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Her heart, her deep, strong, tender heart, is present on
every page of Christiana&rsquo;s noble history.&nbsp; Her heart keeps
her often silent when the water in her eyes becomes all the more eloquent.&nbsp;
When she does let her heart utter itself in words, her words are fine
and memorable.&nbsp; As, for one instance, after Greatheart&rsquo;s
discourse on redemption.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Mercy, that thy father and mother
were here; yea, and Mrs. Timorous also.&nbsp; Nay, I wish with all my
heart now that here was Madam Wanton, too.&nbsp; Surely, surely, their
hearts would be affected, nor could the fear of the one, nor the powerful
lusts of the other, prevail with them to go home again, and to refuse
to become good pilgrims.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was not so much what she
said herself that brought out the depth and tenderness of Christiana&rsquo;s
heart, it was rather the way her heart loosened other people&rsquo;s
tongues.&nbsp; You must all have felt how some people&rsquo;s presence
straitens your heart and sews up your mouth.&nbsp; While there are other
people, again, whose simple presence unseals your heart and makes you
eloquent.&nbsp; We ministers keenly feel that both in our public and
in our private ministrations.&nbsp; There are people in whose hard and
chilling presence we cannot even say grace as we should say it.&nbsp;
Whereas, we all know other people, people of a heart, that is, whose
presence somehow so touches our lips that we always when near them rise
far above ourselves.&nbsp; Christiana did not speak much to her guides
and instructors and companions, but they always spoke their best to
her, and it was her heart that did it.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And then a widow indeed is just a true and genuine widow;
a widow not in her name and in her weeds only, but still more in her
deep heart, in her whole life, and in her garnered experience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Honour widows that are widows indeed.&nbsp; Now, she that is
a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications
and in prayers night and day.&nbsp; Well reported of for good works;
if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she
have washed the saints&rsquo; feet, if she have relieved the afflicted,
if she have diligently followed every good work.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
are the true marks and seals and occupations of a widow indeed.&nbsp;
And if she has had unparalleled trials and irreparable losses, she has
her corresponding consolations and compensations.&nbsp; For she has
a freedom to go about and do good, a liberty and an experience that
neither the unmarried maiden nor the married wife can possibly have.&nbsp;
She can do multitudes of things that in the nature of things neither
of them can attempt to do.&nbsp; Things that would be both unseemly
and impossible for other women to say or to do are both perfectly seemly
and wholly open for her to say and to do.&nbsp; Her widowhood is a sacred
shield to her.&nbsp; Her sorrow is a crown of honour and a sceptre of
authority to her.&nbsp; She is consulted by the young and the inexperienced,
by the forsaken and by the forlorn, as no other human being ever is.&nbsp;
She has come through this life, and by a long experience she knows this
world and the hearts that fill it and make it what it is.&nbsp; A widow
indeed can show a sympathy, and give a counsel, and speak with a weight
of wisdom that one&rsquo;s own mother cannot always do.&nbsp; All you
who by God&rsquo;s sad dispensation are now clothed in the &ldquo;white
and wimpled folds&rdquo; of widowhood, let your prayer and your endeavour
day and night be that God would guide and enable you to be widows indeed.&nbsp;
And, if you do, you shall want neither your occupation nor your honour.</p>
<h2>THE ENCHANTED GROUND</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob,
neither is there any divination against Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Balaam</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I saw then in my dream that they went till they came into
a certain country whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy if he
came a stranger to it.&nbsp; And here Hopeful began to be very dull
and heavy of sleep, wherefore he said unto Christian, I do now begin
to grow so drowsy that I can scarcely hold up mine eyes; let us lie
down here and take one nap.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then when we turn to the
same place in the Second Part we read thus: &ldquo;By this time they
were got to the Enchanted Ground, where the air naturally tended to
make one drowsy.&nbsp; And that place was all grown over with briars
and thorns, excepting here and there, where was an enchanted arbour,
upon which, if a man sits, or in which if a man sleeps, &rsquo;tis a
question, say some, whether they shall ever rise or wake again in this
world.&nbsp; Now, they had not gone far, but a great mist and darkness
fell upon them all, so that they could scarce, for a great while, see
the one the other.&nbsp; Wherefore they were forced for some time to
feel for one another by words, for they walked not by sight.&nbsp; Nor
was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victualling-house
wherein to refresh the feebler sort.&nbsp; Then they came to an arbour,
warm, and promising much refreshing to the pilgrims, for it was finely
wrought above head, beautified with greens, and furnished with couches
and settles.&nbsp; It also had a soft couch on which the weary might
lean.&nbsp; This arbour was called The Slothful Man&rsquo;s Friend,
on purpose to allure, if it might be, some of the pilgrims there to
take up their rest when weary.&nbsp; This, you must think, all things
considered, was tempting.&nbsp; I saw in my dream also that they went
on in this their solitary way till they came to a place at which a man
is very apt to lose his way.&nbsp; Now, though when it was light, their
guide could well enough tell how to miss those ways that led wrong,
yet in the dark he was put to a stand.&nbsp; But he had in his pocket
a map of all ways leading to or from the Celestial City, wherefore he
struck a light (for he never goes also without his tinder-box), and
takes a view of his book or map, which bids him be careful in that place
to turn to the right-hand way.&nbsp; Then I thought with myself, who
that goeth on pilgrimage but would have one of those maps about him,
that he may look when he is at a stand, which is the way to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; asked
Christiana of the guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Enchanted Ground,&rdquo;&mdash;her
able and experienced friend answered her, &ldquo;this is one of the
last refuges that the enemy to pilgrims has; wherefore it is, as you
see, placed almost at the end of the way, and so it standeth against
us with the more advantage.&nbsp; For when, thinks the enemy, will these
fools be so desirous to sit down as when they are weary, and when so
like to be weary as when almost at their journey&rsquo;s end?&nbsp;
Therefore it is, I say, that the Enchanted Ground is placed so nigh
to the land Beulah and so near the end of their race; wherefore let
pilgrims look to themselves lest they fall asleep till none can waken
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That masterpiece of Bunyan&rsquo;s insight
into life, the Enchanted Ground,&rdquo; says Mr. Louis Stevenson, &ldquo;where
his allegory cuts so deep to people looking seriously on life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes, indeed, Bunyan&rsquo;s insight into life!&nbsp; And his allegory
that cuts so deep!&nbsp; For a neophyte, and one with little insight
into life, or into himself, would go to look for this land of darkness
and thorns and pitfalls, alternated with arbours and settles and soft
couches&mdash;one new to life and to himself, I say, would naturally
expect to see all that confined to the region between the City of Destruction
and the Slough of Despond; or, at the worst, long before, and never
after, the House Beautiful.&nbsp; But Bunyan looked too straight at
life and too unflinchingly into his own heart to lay down his sub-Celestial
lands in that way; and when we begin to look with a like seriousness
on the religious life, and especially when we begin to look bold enough
and deep enough into our own heart, then we too shall freely acknowledge
the splendid master-stroke of Bunyan in the Enchanted Ground.&nbsp;
That this so terrible experience is laid down almost at the end of the
Celestial way&mdash;the blaze of light that pours upon our heads fairly
startles us, while at the same time it comforts us and assures us.&nbsp;
That this Enchanted Ground, which has proved so fatal to so many false
pilgrims, and so all but fatal to so many true pilgrims, should lie
around the very borders of Beulah, and should be within all but eye-shot
of the Celestial City itself,&mdash;that is something to be thankful
for, and something to lay up in the deepest and the most secret place
in our heart.&nbsp; That these pilgrims, after all their feastings and
entertainments&mdash;after the Delectable Mountains and the House Beautiful&mdash;should
all be plunged upon a land where there was not so much as a roadside
inn, where the ways were so dark and so long that the pilgrims had to
shout aloud in order to keep together, where, instead of moon or stars,
they had to walk in the spark of a small tinder-box&mdash;what an encouragement
and assurance to us is all that!&nbsp; That is no strange thing, then,
that is now happening to us, when, after our fine communion season,
we have suddenly fallen back into this deep darkness, and are cast into
these terrible temptations, and feel as if all our past experiences
and attainments and enjoyments had been but a self-delusion and a snare.&nbsp;
That we should all but have fallen fast asleep, and all but have ceased
both from watching against sin and from waiting upon God&mdash;well,
that is nothing more than Hopeful himself would have done had he not
had a wary old companion to watch over him, and to hold his eyes open.&nbsp;
Let all God&rsquo;s people present who feel that they are nothing better
of all they have enjoyed of Scriptures and sacraments, but rather worse;
let all those who feel sure that they have wandered into a castaway
land, so dark, so thorny, so miry, and so lonely is their life&mdash;let
them read this masterpiece of John Bunyan again and again and take heart
of hope.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither<br />
And hear how these two pilgrims talk together;<br />
Yea, let them hear of them, in any wise,<br />
Thus to keep ope their drowsy slumb&rsquo;ring eyes;<br />
Saints&rsquo; fellowship, if it be managed well,<br />
Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; But far worse than all its briars and thorns, far more fatal
than all its ditches and pitfalls, were the enchanted arbours they came
on here and there planted up and down that evil land.&nbsp; For those
arbours are all of this fatal nature, that if a man falls asleep in
any of them it arises a question whether he shall ever come to himself
again in this world.&nbsp; Now, where there are no inns nor victualling-houses,
no Gaius and no Mr. Mnason, what a danger all those ill-intended arbours
scattered all up and down that country become!&nbsp; Well, then, the
first enchanted arbour that the pilgrims came to was built just inside
the borders of the land, and it was called The Stranger&rsquo;s Arbour&mdash;so
many new-comers had lain down in it never to rise again.&nbsp; The young
and the inexperienced, with those who were naturally of a believing,
buoyant, easy mind, lay down in hundreds here.&nbsp; Hopeful&rsquo;s
mind was naturally a mind of a soft and easy and self-indulgent cast;
and had he been alone that day, or had he had for a companion a man
of a less wary, less anxious, and less urgent mind than Christian was,
Hopeful had taken a nap, as he so confidingly called it&mdash;a fatal
nap in that arbour built by the enemy of pilgrims, just on purpose for
the young and the ignorant, the inexperienced and the self-indulgent.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Slothful Man&rsquo;s Arbour has been already described.&nbsp;
It was a warm arbour, and it promised much refreshing to the pilgrims.&nbsp;
It also had in it a soft couch on which the weary might lean.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us lie down here and take just one nap; we shall be refreshed
if we take a nap!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not remember,&rdquo; said
the other, &ldquo;that one of the shepherds bid us beware of the Enchanted
Ground?&nbsp; And he meant by that that we should beware of sleeping;
wherefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, what is a nap?&nbsp; And what is it to take a nap in our religion?&nbsp;
The New Testament is full of warnings to those who read it and go by
it&mdash;most solemn and most fearful warnings&mdash;against <i>sleep</i>.&nbsp;
Now, have you any clear idea in your minds as to what this divinely
denounced sleep is?&nbsp; Sleep is good and necessary in our bodily
life.&nbsp; We would not live long if we did not sleep; we would soon
go out of our mind; we would soon lose our senses if we did not sleep.&nbsp;
Insomnia is one of the worst symptoms of our eager, restless, over-worked
age.&nbsp; &ldquo;He giveth His beloved sleep&rdquo;; and while they
sleep their corn grows they know not how.&nbsp; But sleep in the great
exhortation-passages of the Holy Scriptures does not mean rest and restoration;
it means in all those passages insensibility, stupidity, danger, and
death.&nbsp; In our nightly sleep, and in the measure of its soundness,
we are utterly dead to the world around us.&nbsp; Men may come into
our house and rob us of our most precious possessions; they may even
come up to our bed and murder us; our whole house may be in a blaze
about us; we may only awaken to leap out of sleep into eternity.&nbsp;
Now, we are all in a sleep like that in our souls.&nbsp; There is above
us, and around us, and beneath us, and within us the eternal world,
and we are all sound asleep; we are all stone-dead in the midst of it.&nbsp;
Devils and wicked men are stealing our treasures for eternity, and we
are sound asleep; hell is already kindling our bed beneath us, but we
smell not its flames, or we only catch the first gasp of them before
we make our everlasting bed among them.&nbsp; Therefore let us not sleep
as do others, but let us watch and be sober.&nbsp; What meanest thou,
O sleeper? arise and call upon thy God!&nbsp; When the guide shook Heedless
and Too-bold off their settles in that slothful arbour, the one of them
said with his eyes still shut, &ldquo;I will pay you when I take my
money,&rdquo; and the other said, &ldquo;I will fight so long as I can
hold my sword in my hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that one of the children laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the meaning of that?&rdquo; asked Christiana.&nbsp; The
guide said: &ldquo;They talk in their sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they did,
and so do all men.&nbsp; For this whole world is full of settles on
which men sleep and talk in their sleep.&nbsp; The newspapers to-morrow
morning will all be full to overflowing of what men have said and written
to-day and yesterday in their sleep.&nbsp; The shops and the banks and
the exchanges will all be full of men making promises and settling accounts
in their sleep.&nbsp; They will finger their purses, and grasp their
swords, and all in their sleep.&nbsp; And not children but devils will
laugh as they hear the folly that falls from men&rsquo;s lips who are
besotted with spiritual sleep and drugged with spiritual and fleshly
sin.&nbsp; A dream cometh through the multitude of business.&nbsp; I
had just got this length in this lecture the other night when I went
to sleep.&nbsp; And in my sleep one of my people came to me and asked
me if I could make it quite clear and plain to him what it would be
for a man like him after a communion-time to begin to walk with God.&nbsp;
And I just wish I could make the things of the Enchanted Ground as plain
to myself and to you to-night as I was able to make a walk with God
plain to myself and to my visitor that night in my ministerial dream.&nbsp;
I often wish that my business mind worked as well in my study chair
and in my pulpit as it sometimes does in my bed and in my sleep.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep
at this time than ever they did in all their journey.&nbsp; And being
in a muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me: Wherefore musest
thou at the matter?&nbsp; It is the nature of the fruit of the grapes
of those vineyards to go down so sweetly as to cause the lips of them
that are asleep to speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason my poor lips spake
so sweetly about a walk with God that night most have been because I
spent all the summer evening before walking with God and with you in
the vineyards of Beulah.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Listen to Samson, shorn of his locks, as he shakes himself
off a soft and sweetly-worked couch in The Sensual Man&rsquo;s Arbour:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no;<br />
It fits not; thou and I long since are twain;<br />
Nor think me so unwary or accurst<br />
To bring my feet again into the snare<br />
Where once I have been caught; I know thy trains,<br />
Though dearly to my cost, thy gins, and toils;<br />
Thy fair enchanted cup and warbling charms<br />
No more on me have power, their force is null&rsquo;d;<br />
So much of adder&rsquo;s wisdom have I learnt<br />
To fence my ear against thy sorceries.<br />
If in my flower of youth and strength, when all men<br />
Loved, honour&rsquo;d, fear&rsquo;d me, thou alone couldst hate me,<br />
Thy husband, slight me, sell me, and forego me;<br />
How wouldst thou use me now, blind, and thereby<br />
Deceivable, in most things as a child,<br />
Helpless, thence easily contemn&rsquo;d, and scorn&rsquo;d,<br />
And last neglected?&nbsp; How wouldst thou insult,<br />
When I must live uxorious to thy will<br />
In perfect thraldom!&nbsp; How again betray me,<br />
Bearing my words and doings to the lords<br />
To gloss upon, and censuring, frown or smile!<br />
This jail I count the house of liberty<br />
To thine, whose doors my feet shall never enter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5.&nbsp; The love of money to some men is the root of all evil.&nbsp;
There came once a youth to St. Philip Neri and, flushed with joy, told
him that his parents after much entreaty had at length allowed him to
study law.&nbsp; St. Philip was not a man of many words.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
then?&rdquo; the saint simply asked the shining youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
I shall become a lawyer!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; pursued
Philip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I shall
earn a nice sum of money, and I shall purchase a fine country house,
procure a carriage and horses, marry a handsome and rich wife, and lead
a delightful life!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;&mdash;the
youth reflected as death and eternity arose before his eyes, and from
that day he began to take care of his immortal soul.&nbsp; Philip with
one word snatched that young man&rsquo;s soul off The Rich Man&rsquo;s
Settle.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The Vain Man&rsquo;s Settle draws down many men to shame
and everlasting contempt.&nbsp; Praise a vain man or a vain woman aright
and enough and you will get them to do anything you like.&nbsp; Give
a vain man sufficient publicity in your paper or on your platform and
he will become a spy, a traitor, and cut-throat in your service.&nbsp;
The sorcerer&rsquo;s cup of praise&mdash;keep it full enough in a vain
man&rsquo;s hand, and he will sleep in the arbour of vanity till he
wakens in hell.&nbsp; Madam Bubble, the arch-enchantress, knows her
own, and she has, with her purse, her promotion, and her praise, bought
off many a promising pilgrim.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; And then she, by virtue of whose sorceries this whole land
is drugged and enchanted, is such a bold slut that she will build a
Sacred Arbour even, and will fill it full of religious enchantment for
you rather than lose hold of you.&nbsp; She will consecrate places and
persons and periods for you if your taste lies that way; she will build
costly and stately churches for you; she will weave rich vestments and
carve rich vessels; she will employ all the arts; she will even sanctify
and set apart and seat aloft her holy men&mdash;what will she not do
to please you, to take you, to intoxicate and enchant you?&nbsp; She
will juggle for your soul equally well whether you are a country clown
in a feeing-market or a fine lady of &aelig;sthetic tastes and religious
sensibilities in the capital and the court.&nbsp; But I shall let Father
Faber speak, who can speak on this subject both with authority and with
attraction.&nbsp; &ldquo;She can open churches, and light candles on
the altar, and intone <i>Te Deums</i> to the Majesty on high.&nbsp;
She can pass into the beauty of art, into the splendour of dress, and
into the magnificence of furniture.&nbsp; She can sit with high principles
on her lips discussing a religious vocation and praising God and sanctity.&nbsp;
On the benches of bishops and in the pages of good books you will find
her, and yet she is all the while the same huge evil creature.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes; she is all the time the same Madam Bubble who offered to Standfast
her body, her purse, and her bed.</p>
<p>Now, would you know for yourself, like the communicant who came to
me in my sleep, how you are ever to get past all those arbours, and
settles, and seats, and couches, with all their sweet sorceries and
intoxicating enchantments&mdash;would you in earnest know that?&nbsp;
Then study well the case of one Standfast.&nbsp; Especially the time
when she who enchants this whole ground hereabouts set so upon that
pilgrim.&nbsp; In one word, it was this: he remembered his Lord; and,
like his Lord, he fell on his face; and as his Lord would have it, His
servant&rsquo;s lips as they touched the ground touched also the healing
plant harmony and he was saved.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A small unsightly
root,<br />
But of divine effect.<br />
Unknown, and like esteem&rsquo;d, and the dull swain<br />
Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;<br />
And yet more med&rsquo;cinal is it than that moly<br />
That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave;<br />
He call&rsquo;d it haemony, and gave it me,<br />
And bade me keep it as of sovran use<br />
&rsquo;Gainst all enchantments, mildew, blast, or damp,<br />
Or ghastly furies&rsquo; apparition.<br />
And now I find it true; for by this means<br />
I knew the foul enchantress, though disguised,<br />
Enter&rsquo;d the very lime-twigs of her spells,<br />
And yet came off.&nbsp; If you have this about you<br />
(As I will give you when you go) you may<br />
Boldly assault the necromancer&rsquo;s hall:<br />
Where if she be, with dauntless hardihood,<br />
And brandished blade, rush on her, break her glass,<br />
And shed her luscious liquor on the ground,<br />
And seize her wand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prayer, my sin-beset brethren, standfast prayer, is the otherwise
unidentified haemony whose best habitat was the Garden of Gethsemane;
and with that holy root in your heart and in your mouth, there is &ldquo;no
enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE LAND OF BEULAH</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that John Bunyan tells us about the land of Beulah
is this&mdash;that the shortest and the best way to the Celestial City
lies directly through that land.&nbsp; The land of Beulah has its own
indigenous inhabitants indeed.&nbsp; Old men dwell in the streets of
Beulah, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.&nbsp;
The streets of the city also are full of boys and girls playing in the
streets thereof.&nbsp; The land of Beulah has its frequent visitors
also, and its welcome guests from the regions above.&nbsp; Some of the
shining ones come down from time to time and make a short sojourn in
Beulah.&nbsp; The angels in heaven have such a desire to see the lands
from which God&rsquo;s saints come up that at certain seasons all the
suburbs of the Celestial City are full of those shining servants of
God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p>But what made the dreamer to smile and to talk so in his sleep was
when he saw that all the upward ways to the Celestial City ran through
the land of Beulah.&nbsp; He saw also in his dream how all the pilgrims
blamed themselves so bitterly now because they had misspent so much
of their time and strength in the ways below, and so had not come sooner
to see and to taste this blessed land.&nbsp; But, at the same time,
as it was, they all rejoiced with a great joy because that, after all
their delays and all their wanderings, their way still led them through
the borders of Beulah.&nbsp; Now, my dear fellow-communicants, how shall
we find our way at once, and without any more wanderings, into that
so desirable land?&nbsp; How shall we attain to walk its streets all
the rest of our days with our staff in our hand?&nbsp; How shall we
hope to see our boys and our girls playing in the streets of Beulah,
and eating all their days of its sweet and its healing fruits?&nbsp;
How shall we and our children with us henceforth escape the Slough of
Despond, and Giant Despair&rsquo;s dungeon, and the Valley of the Shadow
of Death?&nbsp; The word, my brethren, the answer to all that, is nigh
unto us, even in our mouth and in our heart.&nbsp; For faith, simple
faith, will do all that both for us and for our children beside us.&nbsp;
A heart-feeding faith in God, in the word of God, and in the Son of
God, will do it.&nbsp; Faith, and then obedience.&nbsp; For obedience,
my brethren, is Beulah.&nbsp; All obedience is already Beulah.&nbsp;
Holy obedience will bring the whole of Beulah into your heart and into
mine at any moment.&nbsp; It is disobedience that makes so many of those
who otherwise are true pilgrims to miss so much of the land of Beulah.&nbsp;
Ask any affable old man with his staff in his hand for very age, and
he will tell you that it was his disobedience that kept him so long
out of the land of Beulah.&nbsp; While, let any man, and above all,
let any young man, begin early to live a life of believing obedience,
and he will grow up and grow old and see his children&rsquo;s children
playing around his staff in the streets of Beulah.&nbsp; Let any young
man make the experiment for himself upon obedience and upon Beulah.&nbsp;
Let him not too easily believe any dreamer or even any seer about obedience
and about the land of Beulah.&nbsp; It is his own matter and not theirs;
and let him make experiment upon it all for his own satisfaction and
assurance.&nbsp; Let any young man, then, try prayer as his first step
into obedience, and especially secret prayer.&nbsp; Let him shut his
door to-night, and let him see if he is not already inside one of the
gates of Beulah.&nbsp; Let him deny himself every day also, if it is
only in a very little thing.&nbsp; Let him say sternly to his own heart
every hour of temptation, No! never! and on the spot a sweet waft of
Beulah&rsquo;s finest spices will fall upon his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
ineffable joy of renouncing joy&rdquo; will every day make the lonely
wilderness of this world a constant Beulah to such a man.&nbsp; For,
to live at all times, in all places, and in all things for other men,
and never and in nothing for yourself&mdash;that is the deepest secret
of Beulah.&nbsp; To say it, if need be, three times to-night on your
face and in a sweat of blood, &ldquo;Not my will, but Thine be done!&rdquo;&mdash;that
will to-night turn the garden of Gethsemane itself into the very garden
of Glory.&nbsp; Do you doubt it?&nbsp; Are you not yet able to believe
it?&nbsp; Then hear about it from One who has Himself come through it.&nbsp;
Hear His word upon the whole matter who is the Way, the Truth, and the
Life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come unto Me,&rdquo; says the King of Beulah, &ldquo;all
ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&nbsp;
Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&nbsp; For My yoke is easy and
My burden is light.&rdquo;&nbsp; So after He had washed their feet,
and had taken His garments and was set down again, He said unto them,
&ldquo;Know ye what I have done to you?&nbsp; For I have given you an
example, that ye should do as I have done to you.&nbsp; If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them.&nbsp; If ye love Me, keep My commandments.&nbsp;
And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter,
that He may abide with you for ever.&nbsp; If a man love Me, he will
keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him
and will make Our abode with him.&nbsp; Peace I leave with you, My peace
I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.&nbsp; These
things have I spoken unto you that My joy might remain in you, and that
your joy might be full.&nbsp; Hitherto ye have asked nothing in My name;
ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.&nbsp; Father,
I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And thus I saw in my dream that their way lay right through the land
of Beulah, in which land they solaced themselves for a season.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;They solaced themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, solace
is just the Latin <i>solatium</i>, which, again, is just a soothing,
an assuaging, a compensation, an indemnification.&nbsp; Well, that land
into which the pilgrims had now come was very soothing to their ruffled
spirits and to their weary hearts.&nbsp; It assuaged their many and
sore griefs also.&nbsp; It more than compensated them for all their
labours and all their afflictions.&nbsp; And it was a full indemnification
to them for all that they had forsaken and lost both in beginning to
be pilgrims and in enduring to the end.&nbsp; The children of Israel
had their first solace in their pilgrimage at Elim, where there were
twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they encamped
there by the waters.&nbsp; And then they had their last and crowning
solace when the spies came back from Eshcol with a cluster of grapes
that they bare between two upon a staff, with pomegranates and figs.&nbsp;
And Moses kept solacing his charge all the way through the weary wilderness
with such strong consolations as these: &ldquo;For the Lord thy God
bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains
and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and
barley, and vines, and fig-trees; a land of oil-olive and honey; a land
wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack
anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills
thou mayest dig brass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Lord spake solace to His doubting
and fainting disciples also in many such words as these: &ldquo;Verily,
I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or
brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdom of God&rsquo;s sake,
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the
world to come life everlasting.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mount of Transfiguration
also was His own Beulah-solace; and the Last Supper and the prayer with
which it wound up were given to our Lord and to His disciples as a very
Eshcol-cluster from the Paradise above.&nbsp; Now, I saw in my dream
that they solaced themselves in the land of Beulah for a season.&nbsp;
Yea, here they heard continually the singing of birds.&nbsp; (The Latin
poets called the birds <i>solatia ruris</i>, because they refreshed
and cheered the rustic labourers with their sweet singing.)&nbsp; And
every day the flowers appeared in the earth, and the voice of the turtle
was heard in the land.&nbsp; In this country the sun shineth night and
day, for there is no night there.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this country the sun shineth night and day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How much Standfast must have enjoyed that land of light you may guess
when you recollect that he came from Darkland, which lies in the hemisphere
right opposite to the land of Beulah.&nbsp; In Darkland the sun never
shines to be called sunshine at all.&nbsp; All the days of his youth,
Standfast told his companions, he had sat beside his father and his
mother in that obscure land where to his sorrow his father and his mother
still sat.&nbsp; But in Beulah &ldquo;the rose of evening becomes silently
and suddenly the rose of dawn.&rdquo;&nbsp; This land lies beyond the
Valley of the Shadow of Death, neither could they from this place so
much as see Doubting Castle.&nbsp; Now, Doubting Castle is a dismal
place for any soul of man to be shut up into.&nbsp; And in that dark
hold there are dungeons dug for all kinds of doubting souls.&nbsp; There
are dungeons dug for the souls of men whose doubts are in their intellects,
as well as for those also whose doubts arise out of their hearts.&nbsp;
Some men read themselves into Doubting Castle, and some men sin and
sell themselves to its giant.&nbsp; God casts some of His own children
all their days into those dungeons as a punishment for their life of
disobedience; He casts others down into chains of darkness because of
their idleness and unfruitfulness.&nbsp; But Beulah is far away from
Doubting Castle.&nbsp; Beulah is a splendid spot for a studious man
to lodge in.&nbsp; For what a clear light shines night and day in Beulah!&nbsp;
To what far horizons a man&rsquo;s eye will carry him in Beulah!&nbsp;
What large speculations rise before him who walks abroad in Beulah!&nbsp;
How clear the air is in Beulah, how clean the heart and how unclouded
the eye of its inhabitants!&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s walks are in Beulah,
and the arbours where He delighteth to be.&nbsp; Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall be admitted to see God in the land of Beulah.&nbsp;
In the land of Beulah the sun shall no more be thy light by day, neither
for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but the Lord shall
be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this land also the contract between the bride
and the bridegroom is renewed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, there is no other day
so bitter in any man&rsquo;s life as that day is on which his bridal
contract is broken off.&nbsp; And it is the very perfection and last
extremity of bitterness when his contract is broken off because of his
own past life.&nbsp; Let all those, then, who would fain enter into
that sweet contract think well about it beforehand.&nbsp; Let them look
back into all their past life.&nbsp; For all their past life will be
sure to find them out on the day of their espousals.&nbsp; If they have
their enemies&mdash;as all espoused men have&mdash;this is the hour
and the power of their enemies.&nbsp; The day on which any man&rsquo;s
espousals are published is a small and local judgment-day to him.&nbsp;
For all the men, and, especially, all the women, who have ever been
injured by him, or who have injured themselves upon him; all the men
and all the women who for any reason, and for no reason, hate both him
and his happiness,&mdash;their tongues and their pens will take no sleep
till they have got his contract if they can, broken off.&nbsp; And even
when the bridegroom is too innocent, or the bride too true, or God too
good to let the contract continue long to be broken off, that great
goodness of God and that great trust of his contracted bride will only
make the bridegroom walk henceforth more softly and rejoice with more
trembling.&nbsp; And that is a most excellent mind.&nbsp; I know no
better mind in which any man, guilty or innocent, can enter on a married
life.&nbsp; I sometimes tell the bridegrooms that I can take a liberty
with to keep saying to themselves all the way up to the marriage altar
the tenth verse of the 103rd psalm; as well as when they come up afterwards
to the baptismal font: &ldquo;He hath not dealt with us after our sins
nor rewarded us after our iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is surely
Beulah itself, at its very best, it is surely Beulah above itself, when
a happy bridegroom is full of that humble and happy mind, and when he
is in one and the same moment reconciled both to his bride on earth
and to his God and Father in heaven.&nbsp; In this land, therefore,
in the land of Beulah, the contract between the bride and the bridegroom
is renewed; yea, as the bridegroom rejoiceth over his bride, so shall
thy God rejoice over thee.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The salaams and salutations also that they were met with
as often as they went out to walk in the streets thereof were a constant
surprise, satisfaction, and sweetness to the fearful pilgrims.&nbsp;
No passer-by ever once frowned or scowled upon them because their faces
were Zionward, as they do in our cities.&nbsp; No one ever treated them
with scorn or contempt because they were poor or unlettered.&nbsp; No
man&rsquo;s face either turned dark at them or was turned away from
them as they passed up the street.&nbsp; They never, all the time they
abode in Beulah, took to the lanes of the city to escape the unkind
looks of any of its citizens.&nbsp; Greatheart&rsquo;s hand was never
away from his helmet.&nbsp; His helmet was never well on his head.&nbsp;
His always bare and unhelmeted head said to all the men of Beulah, I
love and honour and trust you.&nbsp; You would not hurt a hair of my
head.&nbsp; And so on, till all the streets of Beulah were one buzz
of salutation, congratulation, and benediction.&nbsp; Here they heard
voices from out of the city, loud voices, saying, Say ye to the daughter
of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him.&nbsp;
Here all the inhabitants of the country called them the holy people,
the redeemed of the Lord, sought out, a city not forsaken.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Now, as they walked in this land they had more rejoicing
than in parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound.&nbsp;
And still drawing nigh to that city they had yet a more perfect view
thereof.&nbsp; It was builded of pearls and precious stones, also the
street thereof was paved with gold, so that by reason of the natural
glory of the city and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it, Christian
with desire fell sick.&nbsp; Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same
disease.&nbsp; Wherefore here they lay by it awhile, crying out because
of their pangs, If you see my beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.&nbsp;
There are in all good cases of recovery three successive stages of soul-sickness.&nbsp;
True, soul-sickness always runs its own course, and it always runs its
own course in its own order.&nbsp; This special sickness first shows
itself when the soul becomes sick with sin.&nbsp; We have that sickness
set forth in many a psalm, notably in the thirty-eighth psalm; and in
a multitude of other scriptures, both old and new, this evil disease
is dealt with if we had only the eyes and the heart to read such scriptures.&nbsp;
The second stage of this sickness is when a sinner is not so much sick
with the sin that dwelleth in him as sick of himself.&nbsp; Sinfulness
in its second stage becomes so incorporate with the sinner&rsquo;s whole
life&mdash;sin so becomes the sinner&rsquo;s very nature, and, indeed,
himself,&mdash;that all his former loathing of sin passes over henceforth
into loathing of himself.&nbsp; This is the most desperate stage in
any man&rsquo;s sickness; but, bad as it is, incurable as it is, it
must be passed into before the third stage of the healing process can
either be experienced or understood.&nbsp; In the case in hand, by the
time the pilgrims had come to Beulah they had all had their full share
of sin and of themselves till they here entered on an altogether new
experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christian with desire fell sick,&rdquo; we
read, &ldquo;and Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease.&nbsp;
Wherefore here they lay by it a while, crying out because of their pangs,
If you see my beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.&rdquo;&nbsp;
David, Paul, Bernard, Bunyan himself, Rutherford, Brainerd, M&rsquo;Cheyne,
and many others crowd in upon the mind.&nbsp; I shall but instance John
Flavel and Mrs. Jonathan Edwards, and so close.&nbsp; John Flavel being
once on a journey set himself to improve the time by meditation, when
his mind grew intent, till at length he had such ravishing tastes of
heavenly joys, and such a full assurance of his interest therein, that
he utterly lost the sight and sense of this world and all its concerns,
so that for hours he knew not where he was.&nbsp; At last, perceiving
himself to be faint, he sat down at a spring, where he refreshed himself,
earnestly desiring, if it were the will of God, that he might there
leave the world.&nbsp; His spirit reviving, he finished his journey
in the same delightful frame, and all that night the joy of the Lord
still overflowed him so that he seemed an inhabitant of the other world.&nbsp;
The only other case of love-sickness I shall touch on to-night I take
from under the pen of a sin-sick and love-sick author, who has been
truthfully described as &ldquo;one of the first, if not the very first,
of the masters of human reason,&rdquo; and, again, as &ldquo;one of
the greatest of the sons of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a young
lady in New-haven,&rdquo; says Edwards, &ldquo;who is so loved of that
Great Being who made and rules the world, that there are certain seasons
in which this Great Being in some way or other invisible comes to her
and fills her mind with exceeding sweet delight, so that she hardly
cares for anything but to meditate upon Him.&nbsp; She looks soon to
dwell wholly with Him, and to be ravished with His love and delight
for ever.&nbsp; Therefore, if you present all this world before her,
with the richest of its treasures, she disregards it and cares not for
it, and is unmindful of any pain or affliction.&nbsp; She has a strange
sweetness in her mind, and a singular piety in her affections; is most
just and conscientious in all her conduct; and you could not persuade
her to do anything wrong or sinful, if you would give her the whole
world.&nbsp; She loves to be alone, walking in the fields and groves,
and seems to have some one invisible always communing with her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so on, all through her seraphic history.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, if such
things are too enthusiastic,&rdquo; says the author of <i>A Careful
and a Strict Enquiry into the Freedom of the Will</i>, &ldquo;if such
things are the offspring of a distempered brain, let my brain be possessed
evermore of that blessed distemper!&nbsp; If this be distraction, I
pray God that the whole world of mankind may all be seized with this
benign, meek, beneficent, beatific, glorious distraction!&nbsp; The
peace of God that passeth all understanding; rejoicing with joy unspeakable
and full of glory; God shining in our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ; with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of God, and being changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord; being called
out of darkness into marvellous light, and having the day-star arise
in our hearts!&nbsp; What a sweet distraction is that!&nbsp; And out
of what a heavenly distemper and out of what a sane enthusiasm has all
that come to us!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More I would speak: but all my words are faint;<br />
Celestial Love, what eloquence can paint?<br />
No more, by mortal words, can be expressed,<br />
But all Eternity shall tell the rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE SWELLING OF JORDAN</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swelling of Jordan.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jeremiah</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fore-fancy your deathbed,&rdquo; says Samuel Rutherford.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take an essay,&rdquo; he says in his greatest book, that perfect
mine of gold and jewels, <i>Christ Dying and Drawing Sinners to Himself</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Take
an essay and a lift at your death, and look at it before it actually
comes to your door.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so we shall.&nbsp; Since it is
appointed to all men once to die, and after death the judgment; and
since our death and our judgment are the only two things that we are
absolutely sure about in our whole future, we shall henceforth fore-fancy
those two events much more than we have done in the past.&nbsp; And
to assist us in that; to quicken our fancy, to kindle it, to captivate
it, and to turn our fancy wholly to our salvation, we have all the entrancing
river-scenes in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> set before us; a
succession of scenes in which Bunyan positively revels in his exquisite
fancies, clothing them as he does, all the time, in language of the
utmost beauty, tenderness, pathos, power, and dignity.&nbsp; Let us
take our stand, then, on the bank of the river and watch how pilgrim
after pilgrim behaves himself in those terrible waters.&nbsp; We are
all voluntary spectators to-night, but we shall all be compulsory performers
before we know where we are.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On entering the river even Christian suddenly began to sink.&nbsp;
Fore-fancy that.&nbsp; All the words he spake still tended to discover
that he had great horror of mind and hearty fears that he would die
in that river; here also he was much in the troublesome thoughts of
the sins he had committed both since and before he began to be a pilgrim.&nbsp;
Fore-fancy that also, all you converted young men.&nbsp; Hopeful, therefore,
had much to do to keep his brother&rsquo;s head above water; yea, sometimes
he would be quite gone down, and then in a while he would rise up again
half-dead.&nbsp; Then I saw in my dream that Christian was in a muse
a while; to whom also Hopeful added this word, &ldquo;Be of good cheer;
Jesus Christ maketh thee whole.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that Christian
broke out with a loud voice, &ldquo;When thou passest through the waters
I will be with thee, and through the rivers they shall not overflow
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they both took courage and the enemy was after
that as still as a stone till they were gone over.&nbsp; Fore-fancy
that also.&nbsp; There is one other thing out of that crossing that
I hope I shall remember when I am in the river: &ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo;
said Hopeful to his sinking fellow&mdash;&ldquo;Be of good cheer, my
brother, I feel the bottom, and it is good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold
His hand fast,&rdquo; wrote Samuel Rutherford to Lady Kenmure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He knows all the fords.&nbsp; You may be ducked in His company
but never drowned.&nbsp; Put in your foot, then, and wade after Him.&nbsp;
And be sure you set your feet always upon the stepping-stones.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes; fore-fancy those stepping-stones, and often practise your feet
upon them before the time.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good woman,&rdquo; said the post to Christiana, the
wife of Christian the pilgrim; &ldquo;Hail, good woman, I bring thee
tidings that the Master calleth for thee, and expecteth thee to stand
in His presence in clothes of immortality within this ten days.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fore-fancy that also.&nbsp; Now the day was come that she must be gone.&nbsp;
And so the road was full of people to see her take her journey.&nbsp;
But, behold, all the banks beyond the river were full of horses and
chariots which were come down from above to accompany her to the city
gate.&nbsp; So she came forth and entered the river with a beckon of
farewell to those that followed her to the river-side.&nbsp; And thus
she went and entered in at the gate with all the ceremonies of joy that
her husband had done before her.&nbsp; Fore-fancy, if you can, some
of those ceremonies of joy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When Mr. Fearing came to the river where was no bridge,
there again he was in a heavy case.&nbsp; Now, he said, he should be
drowned for ever and never see that Face with comfort he had come so
many miles to behold.&nbsp; And here also I took notice of what was
very remarkable; the water of that river was lower at this time than
ever I saw it in all my life.&nbsp; So he went over at last not much
above wet-shod.&nbsp; Fore-fancy and fore-arrange, if it be possible,
for a passage like that.&nbsp; When he was going tip to the gate Mr.
Greatheart began to take his leave of him, and to wish him a good reception
above.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Be fore-assured, also, of a reception like that.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; In process of time there came a post to the town again,
and his business was this time with Mr. Ready-to-halt.&nbsp; So he inquired
him out and said to him, &ldquo;I am come to thee in the name of Him
whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon crutches.&nbsp; And my
message is to tell thee that He expects thee at His table to sup with
Him in His kingdom the next day after Easter.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this
Mr. Ready-to-halt called for his fellow-pilgrims and told them, saying,
&ldquo;I am sent for, and God shall surely visit you also.&nbsp; These
crutches,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I bequeath to my son that he may tread
in my steps, with a hundred warm wishes that he may prove better than
I have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he came to the brink of the river, he
said, &ldquo;Now I shall have no more need of these crutches, since
yonder are horses and chariots for me to ride on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last
words he was heard to say were, &ldquo;Welcome life!&rdquo;&nbsp; Let
all ready-to-halt hearts fore-fancy all that.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Then Mr. Feeble-mind called for his friends and told them
what errand had been brought to him, and what token he had received
of the truth of the message.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for my feeble mind,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that I shall leave behind me, for I shall have no need
of that in the place whither I go.&nbsp; When I am gone, Mr. Valiant,
I desire that you would bury it in a dung-hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; This done,
and the day being come in which he was to depart, he entered the river
as the rest.&nbsp; His last words were, &ldquo;Hold out faith and patience.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fore-fancy such an end as that to your feeble mind also.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Did you ever know a family, or, rather, the relics of a
family, where there was just a decrepit old father and a lone daughter
left to nurse him through his second childhood?&nbsp; All his other
children are either married or dead; but both marriage and death have
spared Miss Much-afraid to watch over the dotage-days of Mr. Despondency;
till one summer afternoon the old man fell asleep in his chair to waken
where old men are for ever young.&nbsp; And in a day or two there were
two new graves side by side in the old churchyard.&nbsp; Even death
could not divide this old father and his trusty child.&nbsp; And so
when the time was come for them to depart, they went down together to
the brink of the river.&nbsp; The last words of Mr. Despondency were,
&ldquo;Farewell night and welcome day.&rdquo;&nbsp; His daughter went
through the river singing, but none could understand what it was she
said.&nbsp; Fore-fancy that, all you godly old men, with a daughter
who has made a husband and children to herself of her old father.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; As I hear Old Honest shouting &ldquo;Grace reigns!&rdquo;
I always remember what a lady told me about a saying of her poor Irish
scullery-girl.&nbsp; The mistress and the servant were reading George
Eliot&rsquo;s Life together in the kitchen, and when they came to her
deathbed, on the pillow of which Thomas A&rsquo;Kempis lay open, &ldquo;Mem,&rdquo;
said the girl, &ldquo;I used to read that old book in the convent; but
it is a better book to live upon than to die upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now,
that was exactly Old Honest&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He lived upon one book,
and then he died upon another.&nbsp; He lived according to the commandments
of God, but he died according to the comforts of the Gospel.&nbsp; Now,
we read in his history how that the river at that time overflowed its
banks in some places.&nbsp; But Mr. Honest had in his lifetime spoken
to one Good-conscience to meet him at the river, the which he also did,
and lent him his hand, and so helped him over.&nbsp; All the same, the
last words of Mr. Honest still were, &ldquo;Grace reigns!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so he left the world.&nbsp; Fore-fancy whether or no you are making,
as one has said, &ldquo;an assignation with terror&rdquo; at that same
river-side.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Standfast was the last of the pilgrims to go over the river.&nbsp;
Standfast was left longest on this side the river because his Master
could best trust him here.&nbsp; His Master had to take away many of
His other servants from the evil to come, but He could trust Standfast.&nbsp;
You can safely trust a man who takes to his knees in every hour of temptation,
as Standfast was wont to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;This river,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;has been a terror to many.&nbsp; Yea, the thoughts of it have
often frighted me also.&nbsp; The waters, indeed, are to the palate
bitter, and to the stomach cold; yet the thoughts of what I am going
to, and of the conduct that awaits me on the other side, doth lie as
a glowing coal at my heart.&nbsp; I see myself now at the end of my
journey, and my toilsome days are all ended.&nbsp; I am going now to
see that head that was crowned with thorns, and that face that was spit
upon for me.&nbsp; His name has been to me as a civet-box, yea, sweeter
than all perfumes.&nbsp; His word I did use to gather for my food, and
for antidotes against my faintings.&nbsp; He has held me up, and I have
kept myself from mine iniquities.&nbsp; Yea, my steps hath He strengthened
in the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, while he was thus in discourse his countenance
changed, his strong man bowed down under him, and after he had said,
&ldquo;Take me, for I come to Thee,&rdquo; he ceased to be seen of them.&nbsp;
Fore-fancy, if you have the face, an end like that for yourself.</p>
<p>This, then, is how Christian and Hopeful and Christiana and Old Honest
and all the rest did in the swelling river.&nbsp; But the important
point is, HOW WILL YOU DO?&nbsp; Have you ever fore-fancied how you
will do?&nbsp; Have you ever, among all your many imaginings, imagined
yourself on your deathbed?&nbsp; Have you ever thought you heard the
doctor whisper, &ldquo;To-night&rdquo;?&nbsp; Have you ever lain low
in your bed and listened to the death-rattle in your own throat?&nbsp;
And have you still listened to the awful silence in the house after
all was over?&nbsp; Have you ever shot in imagination the dreadful gulf
that stands fixed between life and death, and between time and eternity?&nbsp;
Have you ever tried to get a glimpse beforehand of your own place where
you will be an hour after your death, when they are putting the grave-clothes
on your still warm body, and when they are measuring your corpse for
your coffin?&nbsp; Where will you be by that time?&nbsp; Have you any
idea?&nbsp; Can you fancy it?&nbsp; Did you ever try?&nbsp; And if not,
why not?&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; wrote Jeremy Taylor to the Earl
of Carbery, when sending him the first copy of the <i>Holy Dying</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;My
lord, it is a great art to die well, and that art is to be learnt by
men in health; for he that prepares not for death before his last sickness
is like him that begins to study philosophy when he is going to dispute
publicly in the faculty.&nbsp; The precepts of dying well must be part
of the studies of them that live in health, because in other notices
an imperfect study may be supplied by a frequent exercise and a renewed
experience; but here, if we practise imperfectly once, we shall never
recover the error, for we die but once; and therefore it is necessary
that our skill be more exact since it cannot be mended by another trial.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How wise, then, how far-seeing, how practical, and how urgent is the
prophet&rsquo;s challenge and demand.&nbsp; &ldquo;How wilt thou do
in the swelling of Jordan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, let us be practical before we close, and let
us descend to particulars.&nbsp; Let us take the prophet&rsquo;s question
and run it through some parts and some practices of our daily life as
already dying men.&nbsp; And, to begin with, I have such a great faith
in good books, whether we are to live or die, that I am impelled to
ask you all at this point, and under shelter of this plain-spoken prophet,
What books have you laid in for your deathbed, and for the weeks and
months and even years before your death bed?&nbsp; What do you look
forward to be reading when Jordan is beginning to swell and roll for
you and to leap up toward your doorstep?&nbsp; If you get good from
good books&mdash;everybody does not&mdash;but supposing you are one
of those who do, what books can you absolutely count upon, without fail,
to put you in the best possible frame for the river, and for the convoy
across, and for the ceremonies of joy on the other side?&nbsp; What
special Scriptures will you have read every day to you?&nbsp; &ldquo;Read,&rdquo;
said John Knox to his weeping wife, &ldquo;read where I first cast my
anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old lady I once knew used to say to me at every
visit, &ldquo;The Fifty-first Psalm.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was the daughter
of a Highland minister, and the wife of a Highland minister, and the
mother of a Highland minister, and of an elder to boot.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Fifty-first Psalm,&rdquo; she said, and sometimes, &ldquo;One of Hart&rsquo;s
hymns also.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is your favourite psalm and hymn?&nbsp;
Mr. James Taylor of Castle Street has several large-type libraries in
his catalogue.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor might start a much worse paying speculation
than a large-type library for the river-side; or, some select booklets
for deathbeds.&nbsp; The series might well open with &ldquo;The Ninetieth
Psalm&rdquo; in letters an inch deep.&nbsp; Scholars die as well as
illiterates, and there might be provided for them, among other things,
<i>The Ph&aelig;do</i> in two languages, Plato&rsquo;s and Jowett&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Then <i>The Seven Sayings from the Cross</i>.&nbsp; Bellarmine&rsquo;s
<i>Art of Dying Well</i> would stand well beside John Bunyan&rsquo;s
<i>Dying Sayings</i>.&nbsp; And, were I the editor, I would put in Bishop
Andrewes&rsquo; <i>Private Devotions</i>, if only for my own last use.&nbsp;
Then Richard Baxter&rsquo;s <i>Saint&rsquo;s Rest</i>, and John Howe&rsquo;s
Platonico-Puritan book, <i>Blessedness of the Righteous</i>.&nbsp; Then
Bernard&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Jerusalem,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sands of Time
are sinking,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; and such like.&nbsp;
These are some of the little books I have within reach of my bed against
the hour when the post blows his first horn for me.&nbsp; You might
tell me some of your deathbed favourites.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Who will be your most welcome minister during your last
days on earth?&nbsp; For whom would you send to-night if the post were
suddenly to sound his horn at your side on your way home from church?&nbsp;
I can well believe it would not be your own minister.&nbsp; I have known
fathers and mothers in this congregation to send for other ministers
than their own minister when terrible trouble came upon them, and both
my conscience and my common sense absolutely approved of the step they
took.&nbsp; Five students were once sitting and talking together in
a city in which there was to be an execution to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
They were talking about the murderer who was to be executed in the morning,
and about the minister he had sent for to come to see him.&nbsp; And,
like students, they began to put it to one another&mdash;Suppose you
were to be executed to-morrow, for what minister in the city, or even
in the whole land, would you send?&nbsp; And, like students again, they
said&mdash;Let each one write down on a piece of paper the name of the
minister he would choose to be beside him at the last, and we shall
see each man&rsquo;s last choice.&nbsp; They did so, when to their astonishment
it was discovered that they had all written the same minister&rsquo;s
name!&nbsp; I do not know that they all went to his church every Sabbath
while they were young and, well, and not yet under sentence of death.&nbsp;
I do not think they did.&nbsp; For when I was in his church there was
only a handful of old and decayed-looking people in it.&nbsp; The chief
part of the congregation seemed to me to be a charity school.&nbsp;
And I gathered from all that a lesson&mdash;several lessons, and this
among the rest&mdash;that crowded passages do not always wait upon the
best pastors; and this also, that a waft of death soon discovers to
us a true minister from an incompetent and a counterfeit minister.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Writing to one of his correspondents about his correspondent&rsquo;s
long-drawn-out deathbed, Samuel Rutherford said to him, &ldquo;It is
long-drawn-out that you may have ample time to go over all your old
letters and all your still unsettled accounts before you take ship.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Have you any such old letters lying still unanswered?&nbsp; Have you
any such old accounts lying still unsettled?&nbsp; Have you made full
reparation and restitution for all that you and yours have done amiss?&nbsp;
Fore-fancy that you will soon be summoned into His presence who has
said: &ldquo;herefore, if thou bring thy gift before the altar, and
there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there
thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift.&nbsp; Agree with thine adversary
quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know
all about Zacchaeus.&nbsp; I need not tell his story over again.&nbsp;
But as I write these lines I take up a London newspaper and my eyes
light on these lines: &ldquo;William Avary was a man of remarkable gifts,
both of mind and character.&nbsp; He dedicated the residue of his strength
wholly to works of piety.&nbsp; In middle age he failed in business,
and in his old age, when better days came, he looked up such of his
old creditors as could be found and divided among them a sum of several
thousand pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look up such of your old creditors as
you can find, and that not in matters of money alone.&nbsp; And, be
sure you begin to do it now, before the horn blows.&nbsp; For, as sure
as you take your keys and open your old repositories, you will come
on things you had completely forgotten that will take more time and
more strength, ay, and more resources, than will then be at your disposal.&nbsp;
Even after you have begun at once and done all that you can do, you
will have to do at last as Samuel Rutherford told George Gillespie to
do: &ldquo;Hand over all your bills, paid and unpaid, to your Surety.&nbsp;
Give Him the keys of the drawer, and let Him clear it out for Himself
after you are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And then, pray often to God for a clear mind between Him
and you, and for a quick, warm, and heaven-hungry heart at the last.&nbsp;
And take a promise from those who watch beside your bed that they will
not drug and stupefy you even though you should ask for it.&nbsp; Whatever
your pain, and it is all in God&rsquo;s hand, make up your mind, if
it be possible, to bear it.&nbsp; It cannot be greater than the pain
of the cross, and your Saviour would not touch their drugs, however
well-intended.&nbsp; He determined to face the swelling of Jordan and
to enter His Father&rsquo;s house with an unclouded mind.&nbsp; Try
your very uttermost to do the same.&nbsp; I cannot believe that the
thief even would have let the gall so much as touch his lips after Christ
had said to him, &ldquo;To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, if your mind was ever clear and keen, let it be at its clearest
and its keenest at the last.&nbsp; Let your mind and your heart be full
of repentance, and faith, and love, and hope, and all such saying graces,
and let them all be at their fullest and brightest exercise, at that
moment.&nbsp; Be on the very tip-toe of expectation as the end draws
near.&nbsp; Another pang, another gasp, one more unutterable sinking
of heart and flesh as if you were going down into the dreadful pit&mdash;and
then the abundant entrance, and the beatific vision!&nbsp; What wilt
thou do then?&nbsp; What wilt thou say then?&nbsp; Hast thou thy salutation
and thy song ready?&nbsp; And what will it be?</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
